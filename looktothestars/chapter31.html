<p>
Again the world was at war.  Actually, the twenty years between the signing of the Versailles Treaty and the time Germany invaded Poland was more like an armed truce than a period of peace.  World War I was a struggle for empire and power.  So was World War II, but it was also a struggle between democracy and fascism.  President Roosevelt called it a “war for survival.”
</p>

<p>
Adolf Hitler, dictator of Germany, was a megalomaniac, possessing the same kind of world power ideas that Kaiser Bill once had.  Isaiah must have witnessed the scenes of World War II when he asked the Lord to close the vision.  The most horrible accounts of human torture that can be conceived came out of the Second World War.  In this conflict, the different theaters of war affected every ocean and continent.  It was a total war.  When Germany invaded Russia, reporters commented, “Let dog eat dog.”
</p>

<p>
Our ward had farewell parties for every departing service man and missionary, with dancing, cake, and freezer ice cream.  Big money jobs with Uncle Sam boomed across the land, with wages as high as $60 a week.  All it took to become a carpenter for Uncle was a pair of white overalls and the willingness to leave home.  There was a general exodus of farmers rushing to Nevada to build barracks and ammunition dumps.  Orchards and fields were forsaken.  The gold rush was on.
</p>

<p>
Marilyn turned eight years old in January, and Winferd baptized her in one of the private baths behind the swimming pool.  After he pulled the board to let the water out of the bath, we left Marilyn to dress.  As I stood outside her door, I heard the water pounding from the spillway into the empty bath.  Then came a crash and a scream.  Pushing the door open, I peered through the steam.  The bench Marilyn had been sitting on had rolled with her into the cement pit below.  She lay with the bench on top of her, and the water splashing over her.  Poor, bewildered little girl.  I gathered her up and soothed her.
</p>

<p>
The following day, Winferd and I faced the greatest test of our married life&mdash;that of parting.  He had been a farm hand for Mr. Graff, but now the “gold fever” hit him.  Now was the time to make some of the big money so we could finish our home.  Six people crowded into our little garage was beginning to be a problem.  In our twelve years together, we had never been apart, except for a day or two at a time.  Suddenly I felt timid and uncertain of myself.  Could I cope with being without him?  Then I was buoyed up with the thought that the Lord wouldn’t want me to be a weakling.  I’d pray earnestly every day, and we would get along just fine.
</p>

<p>
Brother Iverson offered to take our milk cow.  I had never confessed to Winferd that I knew how to milk, because I didn’t want anyone to expect it of me.  But now I said, “Thanks, Brother Iverson.  I will take care of the cow myself.”
</p>

<p>
<a href="view.html#scan=172" class="scanlink">162</a> On January the 12th, Winferd left for Nevada, and I was left with our four children, the cow, and a flock of chickens.  With a queer, hollow feeling, I realized Winferd would not be home for supper.  He wouldn’t even be home when darkness fell.  He wouldn’t be bringing in the bucket of milk for me to strain.  I was on my own! My heart trembled.  Cry?  Who, me?  Oh, no, not I.  I would think brave, strong thoughts.  I walked through our new house.  The windows were in, the floors laid, and the doors hung.  Exciting projects leaped to my mind.  “I’ll clean the putty off the glass.  I’ll paint the baseboards, the doors, and the closets.  I’ll get the lot plowed and planted, and put in fruit trees and berry bushes.”   Projects presented themselves to my mind with exciting rapidity, and mentally were as speedily accomplished.  For a full twenty-four hours I felt the strength of Atlas and the speed of light.
</p>

<p>
Then I listened to my trembling heart and whispered, “I am not big and brave.  I’m little and alone.”  After the children were asleep, I walked under the stars and wept, “Come back, Winferd.  I can’t live without you.”  Loneliness stalked every quiet moment.  How thankful I was for the children.  How blessed, I thought, is the house that is noisy with children.
</p>

<p>
For two anxious weeks we called at the post office, then finally a letter came from Winferd.  He had checked out jobs in different localities and at last had arrived at Hawthorne, Nevada.
</p>

<p>
Brief excerpts from parts of our letters will pick up our story:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Hawthorne, Nevada, January 22, 1942</em>
</p>

<p>
Dear Alice and family:  Journey’s end for the present.  Arrived here about 4:20 yesterday and spent the rest of the time till 9 looking for a place to lay our heads, then Elmer and Leona Hardy opened their davenport for us.
</p>

<p>
The ride out was uneventful and there is little to see but the same kind of hills with no vegetation except shad and match brush.  No trees hardly the whole day. &hellip; This morning we went to locate a job and got a place to fix up here in town.  The other work is out of town from two to four miles.  A Greek is having his bar enlarged and we go to work at noon.  The other big job we came up here for is held up for material, so this little town job will tide us to the time the other outfit can use men. &hellip; This is just a note to put your mind at ease somewhat.  I have been imagining all the fun (?) you’ve been having since I am out of the picture.  Still, I hope “distance lends enchantment” to a point where you can still go on thinking a few kind things.  When I know where I can change my mind, ways, clothes, or do as I please, I will have a little more to say on the subject, but now I will just leave it to I love you always.  Winferd.
</p>

<em>LaVerkin, January 24, 1942</em>
</p>

<p>
Dear Winferd, we’ve had your letter about two hours, but it seems if I write back at once, I may speed the next word from you.  Norman brought your letter in while we were at the dinner table.  The kids hovered breathlessly over my chair while I opened and read the precious document.  I admit I felt somewhat the same as they.
</p>

<p>
Norman complained that Jane and Dee had letters from their daddy that were all theirs.  He and Marilyn wanted to divide your letter.
</p>

<p>
DeMar cried for you last night.  That’s the first time he’s mentioned you.  It’s odd, but he’s never thought of saying his prayers until the first night you were away.  He listened from his bed to Marilyn and Norman, then he called, “Com’mere Mudder.  Mar get up say blessing.”  I let him out of his snuggler and he kneeled in his bed while I helped him.  Each night since, this has been repeated.  I’d say, “...and take good care of Daddy and bring him home to us.”  He’d repeat it after me each time, but last night he started to cry when we got to there.  He said, “Daddy come home,” over and over.
</p>

<p>
I suppose you’re overcome with curiosity about me and the “old sot” (the cow). Well, I’ll put your mind at rest.  We’re getting along famously.  Fact is, the old gal has concluded that I’m quite nice.  I lead her to the tap each time and let her carry her own water.  While she’s here at the house, we get the milking done, the cow and I.  She sniffs the stool each time, trying to make out what it’s for.  (Winferd never used a milk stool.) It took me one-half hour the first time I milked.  Yield: One gallon.  Gradually we’ve increased to nine quarts a milking.  I was so elated at first, I could have kissed the cow, but I got over that.  My milking muscles that have slumbered all these years, began to groan and creak over the sudden burst of activity.  I’m lame up both arms, clear to my ears.
</p>

<p>
Your dad and Uncle Joe brought a bunch of Wickli names from Switzerland for me to type on family group sheets.  They don’t know I’m too lame to plunk a typewriter.  My days are crammed to the brim and topsy-turvy.  I can only type a little in the evenings.  My world is upside down.  Everything I do seems but a part of a strange dream. My senses have all suffered a relapse.  I do not cry.  I could not.  I feel nothing of fear, loneliness, anxiety, in fact, I feel nothing, only my arms.  I work harder than ever before.  I shut you up in my mind and heart and try not to let you out.  Otherwise, I would be swept away in a flood of loneliness that I could not endure.
</p>

<p>
I raked yards most of the morning and turned over a corner of garden for lettuce and fenced it off with chicken wire. Van will plow the lot when it’s dry enough.  It’s still too soggy...Goodbye, and lots of love.  Alice

P.S. Shirley is sitting on my lap watching the pen with great interest.  She’s a perfect darling.

<p>
&hellip;Well, I joined the union, or should I say, paid my first fee to the tune of $10.00.  I am supposed to pay a dollar a day for each day I work till my $50 is in, then I get my card good anywhere.&hellip;I eat at cafes and sleep in hotels, so it is sure costing plenty, when you think of spending $1.00 a night for bed and an average of 50 cents for regular meals.
</p>

<p>
This burg harks back to the good old days.  I tell you, there is plenty of the same spirit.  Gambling bars everywhere.  There must be ten places here, or more, big saloon type places (bars) and believe me, the gangs do pile in and toss around the cash.  There was supposed to be a dancer at one place last nite.  We went down to see her, but it was plenty tame.  I think every girl and woman smokes and drinks and they all have the genuine look of the roaring ’50s when these mine towns were booming.  This village is about as crumby a place as ever was.
Shacks all over with no regard for cleanliness

or anything.  Old frame shacks of the old past and no sidewalks to speak of&hellip;I pray all is well with my family, and I do look forward to getting a letter.  Best wishes and all my love, Winferd.

<em>LaVerkin, January 27</em>
</p>
<p>Dear Winferd&hellip;I’ve just come in from Mutual.  I stood around after it was out, waiting.  Suddenly I realized you were not walking home with me.  I looked around the hall, and you were not there.  I haven’t come to the realization yet that you are really and truly gone.  I keep thinking of things to tell you when you come home at night, and then with a queer feeling I remember you are not coming.
</p>

<p>
Your folks are so nice.  Rosalba, Van, and your dad all came Sunday afternoon,.  Van milked the cow Sunday night and tonight.  Your dad staked her out.  Kate stayed all day Sunday.  I took her home in the flivver at nine at night.  I’ve parked it to stay now.  It has developed a new complaint.  The kids (your kids) have wounded it fatally.  That old pitchfork was hanging over the front bumper when I went to use the car, and as I filled the radiator, water spurted like a geyser from the front of the radiator.  I suspect the fork on the bumper explains the hole.
</p>

<p>
Van plowed our place today, and you should see it.  It is sticky and boggy.  He suggests that I let it dry hard to slack and clods, and then pond it with water, and when it’s dry enough, harrow it.  He’s going to come down the last of the week to look at it.
</p>

<p class="vpad"></p>

<p>
Wednesday, 11 p.m.  Thank you so much.  Your letter came today.  We were so happy to hear from you.  Marilyn brightened when I read in you letter that you were thinking of Las Vegas, that you might come home once in awhile.
</p>

<p>
Sister Church, Sister Thompson, and Sister Stratton were here when Norman brought the mail in.  (The Relief Society Presidency.  I was a counselor to Sister Church, along with Gretchen Stratton.  Kate Thompson was the secretary.) They left at 4:30.  They were here two hours.  I could hardly wait to open your letter&hellip;We are going to knit for the Red Cross in Relief Society, so I suppose I’ll be learning the art&hellip;
</p>

<p class="vpad"></p>

<p>
Thursday.  “All things come to him who waits!”  How many times have you aggravated me with that statement?  I could not post my letter yesterday because those ladies stayed too late, and anyway, I didn’t want to post it until after I had your package in the mail.
</p>

<p>
LaPriel and Jimmy went to California for their honeymoon.  They were coming back here before he goes in the army.  (Cornelius.)
</p>

<p>
Pop and Clint looked in on us yesterday to see how we were surviving your absence.  All of a sudden folks are kind and thoughtful as though there had been a bereavement in the family.  The similarity is striking&hellip;
</p>

<p class="vpad"></p>

<p>
Later.  There was another letter from you.  My, but we did enjoy it&hellip;You know, the funniest thing, Sunday during church, the thought came to me, “Winferd was called to speak in Sacrament meeting today.” And sure enough, you were!  That’s pretty good, isn’t it!
</p>

<p>
I’ve checked everywhere.  Nobody has a scrap of hay to spare.  I stake the cow around, and she does quite well.

<em>January 27</em> -  Marilyn dictating:  Dear Daddy - The chickens sure wish they could get in the car to lay an egg.  They are always jumping up and looking in the window and thinking how nice it would be.  They sure wish they could lay an egg.  The new yellow chickens are laying now.  There is a nest in the basement and there is one under the bridge by the berry bushes.  I looked down the ditch bank and behind the currants and i found a rotten egg and I stomped on it and the top blew off and went “plunk” way up in the air.  Sure was funny.  We sended your parcel too.  From Marilyn
</p>

<p>
Norman dictating:  Dear Daddy, my trike seat came off.  Marilyn pulled it clear out and I took the pliers and fixed it and then it wouldn’t turn.  It would be a good idea to go down to Las Vegas and then you could come home some Sundays.  Mother saw a bee when she was out washing one day and she told me to bring my cherry plants outside so they could get cherries on.  And lots of love X O O X from Norman

<em>January 29</em> &hellip; This is the most measly town you’ve ever heard of.  Thora says practically everyone in town has measles.  Marilyn has come down with them now.
</p>

<p class="aside noindent vpad">
<b>Note:</b>  Winferd shares a room with Luther Fuller (Lew).  His letters are sprinkled with Lew’s views.  Since Lew took possession of the two-foot table for his correspondence, all of Winferd’s letters were penned on his knee as he sat on the edge of the bed.  Lew prefers the outside of the bed, so Winferd has to climb over him, mornings and nights.  “One day I’m going to have a bed with two outsides.”  The Sears Catalog is Winferd’s encyclopedia, which brings forth Lew’s scorn.  For three days they debated (argued) over who sold the best tools, Sears or Pennys.  Three of Winferd’s letters were filled with the debate.  Winferd says Lew was bullheaded.  Of course, Winferd wasn’t.  He just hung doggedly to his original opinion.  The debate was a tie.

<p>
<em>LaVerkin, February 3</em>  &hellip;Shirley has discovered her feet.  She sticks them up in the air all the while she’s awake and watches them.  Her booties won’t stay on five minutes.  I buttoned those little red doll shoes on her today.  That tickled the kids.  Norman wanted me to put her down and let her walk.  He insisted she could if I’d just let go of her.  Marilyn is still in bed with the measles, but she got up to see Shirley.  The kids screamed and laughed so much at her that she became as delighted as they were.  I wheeled her bed into the front room where the kids could watch her, she was so interested in the shoes.
</p>

<p>
&hellip;You’d feel repaid if you could see how delighted the kids were with the cards you wrote them.  They carried them around all afternoon.  Norman says, “Daddy sure can write good letters, can’t he.”  DeMar has been rigging up a play car today.  He says, “Fix a car up and go find Daddy.”

<p>&hellip;When I was introduced to Maud Reid’s mother, Maud said, “This is Mrs. Gubler, Mother.”  Her mother said, “Indeed?  That is number twenty.  I’ve counted them all and you are the twentieth Mrs. Gubler.” &hellip;I wanted to tell you how much we want a buggy for Shirley.  It has been such wonderful weather.  Shirley could have enjoyed it so much if I’d had a buggy for the kids to wheel her about on the square.  When I look at the baby laying in her bed, with all this spring weather going to waste, and the kids needing occupation, I mentally take the buggy out of the luxury class and put it down among the necessities.

Later:  What is a person supposed to do when the cow gets too affectionate?  I just came in from milking.  I got a handful of hay and came up the lane with it so she’d follow to water.  If I didn’t do that, I’d have to tug and tug on her chain to pull her past the hay.  She kept stepping a little faster and stretching her neck a little longer, and I kept stepping faster until finally we were running, and I got scared, so when she grabbed the hay, I let her have it, and we were only to the sand pile by then.  I tried to gather some of the hay and come on, but she made awful noises at me.  Worse noises than you’ve ever heard her do, and she looked funny, too. When she finally came for a drink, I sat on the stool to milk her and she kept sliding over to me, and I kept hitching my stool back a little further, like she was going to lay down on me, and I was thinking how heavy she’d be.  Finally, she turned her head way around and looked at me.  I wondered whether she was friend or foe, then she sniffed at my sweater and tried to lick my face.  I think she likes me, but I hope she doesn’t expect me to romp with her.  When I staked her out, she bucked and took after me.  I ran.  I was glad she could only go to the end of her chain.
</p>

<p>
Sugar rationing makes me mad.  On one of those defense broadcasts, they said there would be enough for our needs.  Well, the store is out of sugar.  They’ve used up all of their allotment and won’t be able to get any more for awhile, and when they do, people will have to buy $2.50 worth of groceries for each ten pounds of sugar, and then it costs 75&cent; for the sugar.  And we don’t even buy groceries.  We have all the milk, eggs, butter, etc. we can possibly use, with the fruits and vegetables we grow.  As I said before, it makes me mad.

(<b>Note:</b> Times were crazy.  Because of the war, building material and everything containing metal was frozen.  Metal was reserved for ammunition and building material for barracks and ammunition dumps.  Fabrics were reserved for uniforms.  For a time, all yard goods disappeared from store shelves.  People, in a panic, had begun hoarding.  To buy nylons, one had to be on a black market mailing list.  For a price, you could get six pair, all of which shot runners at the first wearing.  Lines formed at checkout stands in the big stores.  When customers saw a lineup, they automatically got in it, knowing that some extinct item was being dispensed at the other end.  It didn’t matter what it was.  If it was hard to get, everyone wanted it.  Meat, sugar, and gas were rationed.  People had to register the number in their household before they could receive stamps to buy them.)

<p>Here it is just after meeting and I still feel the need of visiting with you, Sweetheart.  After years of only having Sunday as a day of leisure, working early and late the others, and spending what time I could where you were, I did it this way.
</p>

<p>
It is such a beautiful day.  The lake looks beautiful down the valley and the pure white tops of the mountains west are restful and serene.  It would be a pleasure to climb the hill.
</p>

<p>
Today has been nice for several reasons.  The Stake President, Brother Hurst, and Relief Society Stake President, Sister Purdy, were here for meeting.  They had to drive 136 miles to get here, so their visit meant quite something.  Willard Duncan and Brig Hardy’s son Frank played a duet with accordion and guitar, “O My Father,” and it was nice, too.  Brother Hughes, Superintendent of Sunday School, had a heart attack and the doctor gave him up completely.  They had the Priesthood in and held prayer circles and feel like the hand of death had been stayed.  The doctor said only some magic power saved him.
</p>

<p>
I wish I could hurry and get my debts off my mind.  They’re heavy.  I do considerable daydreaming for a man of my age, but then I need some pleasurable time consumer to to keep up my spirits.  Our needs are so many and our wants quite a few.  I grow impatient.  I buy up no more dead horses after the herd is paid for, providing my purchases can be timed to travel alongside the purse.  My daydreaming is not always on just financial lines.  I spend a lot of time connected with my family and their needs.
</p>

<p>
How my love goes out to all of you.  There is far more pull in your direction than I ever could have known when you were single, much as I loved you then.  I think you are a good sport, a brave woman, a lovely pal, and the sweetheart of all my idealism.

Got your clock turned on tonite?  Never did see just what good that faster time did for anyone.  Makes me peeved. &hellip; Oh, my, I’ve been on the go so much and an hour earlier out here that I begin to get my usual Sunday weariness and with only a half rest all day.  Guess I’ll join L.C. (Lew) and take my beauty sleep.  If I’m up early, I can add a few fresh lines tinted by morning sunshine.  Bless you dear for your virtues, and I’ve asked it at the right place for “his” too. Good nite and pleasant dreams.  W.

&hellip; The one that’s away from home misses out on the fun of the family.  The kids are swell.  Shirley is the cutest little tyke I’ve ever met.  She’s unbelievably good.  I’m too busy during week days to hardly look at her, but I’ve been playing with her this afternoon.  DeMar is cute, too.  Shirley was fussing a while ago, and he took a book to her crib.  “Don’t cry, Shirley,” he said, “Mar read a tory.”

Kate slept here Friday night and we talked until one a.m.  I was dopey all day, and then last night I was up till midnight.  My usual Saturday night jinks.

When I finally took him out, there was nothing left but the zipper.

Marilyn is broken out with measles again.  Dr. McIntire says to keep her down, but she’s bounding all over.  Her eyes are awfully red.  I’ve carried <a href="view.html#scan=178" class="scanlink">168</a> a tray of food to her bed each meal until this morning.  I decided it was silly.  She’s been in here half the time, crawling back in bed when I started to fix a meal.  She gets a thrill out of that tray.  Man!  Has she got galloping consumption! She’s constantly shouting that she's hungry.  With elation she counts each dish I put on her tray.  She can't comprehend my extravagance with dishes.  I put everything on at once to shut her up so I won't have to trot my legs off.  Being an invalid is just one big vacation to her.

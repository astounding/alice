<p>From a paragraph near the bottom of section three of a historic brochure from 1920 titled "Rules and Regulations" found online as of October 2010 on the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service web site</a> at the following address&mdash;
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/brochures/1920/grca/sec3.htm">http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/brochures/1920/grca/sec3.htm</a>
&mdash; it appears that there was a "Wiley Way" camp at the north rim of the Grand Canyon National Park.  One wonders if the "Wiley Way" mentioned in Alice's book was a similar camp, perhaps operated by the same organization or person(s) as the one at the Grand Canyon, only located in Zion National Park.</p>

<p>From the aforementioned brochure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="noindent center"><b>WILEY WAY CAMP ON NORTH RIM</b></p>
  <p class="noindent">At Bright Angel Point on the North Rim is "Wiley Way" Tourist Camp, consisting of a central dining tent and comfortable sleeping tents, with accommodations for 25 persons. Rates are $6 per day.</p>

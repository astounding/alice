<p>
In <a href="../chapter19.html#antelope_cave">Chapter 19</a>, Alice describes her first
visit to Antelope Cave in 1930 with her husband, Winferd, who discovered the cave "some years back"--most likely in the earily 1920s or perhaps a tad earlier.  The cave is in northern Arizona, southwest of Colorado City and Hilldale, southeast of Hurricane, Utah, very close to where a large power transmission line traverses the Arizona Strip, Mohave County, Arizona.
</p>

<p>
The cave was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 10 October, 1975.
</p>

<p>
In the <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B1MLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kFIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5725%2C768294">November 13, 1974 issue of the Kingman Daily Miner, Roman Malach published an article in his column, Malach Writes, titled "Dusty Trip to Antelope Cave"</a> wherein he shares a lot of interesting information about the cave and various archealogical excavations that have taken place there.  He doesn't mention Winferd's discovery of the cave, nor the apparently earlier-than-1950 digs by Brigham Young University.
</p>

<p>
Because of the historical and archeaological significance of this site, public access to the cave is prohibited.  Thick, steel bars prevent access to unauthorized persons.

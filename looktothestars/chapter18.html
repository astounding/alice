One day, after the sewing room was cleaned, I sauntered home with my
armload of school books.  The afternoon sun was warm and the air smelled
of spring.  Although it was still February, the apricots were in bloom.
Papa was anxiously waiting as I came into the house.
</p>

<p>
"Emil Graff wants to talk to you," he said.
</p>

<p>
Afraid to hope, I hurried to the store, where Mr. Graff sat me down
in the shoe room.
</p>

<p>
"How would you like to clerk a few hours after school each day?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
How would I like!  How would I like to <em>not</em> pick up chips anymore?
How would I like to <em>not</em> be a janitor anymore?  How would I like to have
the moon?  All of the shoe boxes on the shelves looked friendly.
</p>

<p>
"I would <em>love</em> it," I replied.
</p>

<p>
Briefly he explained store policy and wages then said, "Be prepared
to start work on the first of March."
</p>

<p>
My feet scarcely touched ground as I flew home.  Excitedly I burst
through the door.  "I'm going to clerk in the store," I announced.  Mama
smiled and Papa blinked.
</p>

<p>
How much of what happened next was coincidence, or how much was maneuvered,
I wasn't certain, but the first salesman that showed up in the store
after I started clerking, was from a correspondence school.  It just happened
that he had already visited Mr. Moody at the High School, and had been to
see Papa.  Well, he sold me a course in shorthand and business correspondence,
along with a beloved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company">Underwood Typewriter</a> (rebuilt).   Now  I could
clerk all afternoon, and go to school only one-half a day.  At nights I
studied.  Papa dictated shorthand and timed speed tests, and my completed
lessons began to fly in the mail to Chicago.  The corrected ones, along
with my grades, were returned to Milton Moody, the High School Principal.

<p>
One day, Mr. Moody called me into his office.  "You have been chosen
to be the Valedictorian at the graduation exercises.  We also need your
picture for the Year Book."  Year book pictures were taken the day we were
at the B.A.C., so we missed out.
</p>

<p>
To make my senior picture special, I got my first beauty parlor appointment
for a <a href="#onlinenote_marcelwave">marcel</a>.  Most of the girls had their hair "bobbed off".  Cut,
that is.  Papa wouldn't hear of such a thing.  My hair was long, done up in
braids, and wound around my ears.
</p>

<p>
"Be not the first the new to try, nor yet the last to lay the old
aside,"<div class="footnote">(<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_Criticism">"An Essay on Criticism"</a> by <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alexander_Pope">Alexander Pope</a>)</div> Papa often recited, then he would add, "A woman's hair is her crown
of glory, and it can't be, if it is cut."
</p>

<p>
With the help of Isaiah, he kept us in line by quoting, "Therefore, 
the Lord will smite with a scab, the crown of the head of the daughters of
Zion&hellip;instead of sweet smell there shall be stink;&hellip;and instead
of well set hair, baldness."<a href="http://classic.scriptures.lds.org/en/isa/3/17,24#17" class="footnote">(Isaiah 3:17,24)</a>  Each night as I tumbled into bed, with my
braids falling across my pillow, I'd think, "Well, at least I still have
<a href="scans.html?p=98" class="scanlink">92</a>
my crown of glory."  I didn't want to be one of the wanton creatures that
fulfilled Isaiah's prophecy.  Still, Papa failed to notice that we were the
"last to lay the old aside".
</p>

<p>
My friends harangued me, and now that I was clerking, customers tormented
me constantly with the question, "When are you going to cut your
hair?"  Like water dripping on a rock, it was wearing me down.
</p>

<p>
As I sat in the beauty parlor chair. Hazel Langston took one fat braid
in her hand and asked,"How would you like to have your hair cut, Alice?"
</p>

<p>
Her assistant, Felma Webb, grabbed the other braid.  "Oh Alice, please
let us cut your hair."
</p>

<p>
I didn't believe they were serious.  Those braids had been a part of
me for eighteen years.  Jokingly I said, "Go ahead."
</p>

<p>
With heavy shears. Hazel whacked off a braid, dangling it before me.
A sickening fear swept through me.  Gleefully she asked, "Do you still
want your hair cut?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure," I gulped.  What else could I say?
</p>

<p>
Never were two beauty operators more enthusiastic than Hazel and Felma
as they worked on me together.  They had so much fun they should have paid
me, instead of me paying them.  When the cutting and <a href="#onlinenote_marcelwave">marcelling</a> was done,
they held a mirror in front of me.  What a doll!  I felt self-conscious
looking so cute.  But I didn't dare go home for dinner.  I just skipped it,
and went to work instead.  All afternoon I was heaped with compliments.  By
quitting time, I felt like a blue-ribbon exhibit.
</p>

<p>
The news ran ahead of me.  As I opened our front door, even before
Papa looked at me, he exclaimed in disgust, "You've made a mess of yourself."
Nothing more was said.  Days later, I heard him confess to Joe Englestead
that cut hair was neater than long.
</p>

<p>
My graduation dress was a pink, fluttery thing that sparkled with rhinestones.
It gave me composure.  The thoughts for my valedictorian address
were triggered by a couple of poems.  The first one was <a href="#onlinenote_opportunitypoems">"Opportunity"</a>
by John James Ingalls:
</p>

<div class="poetrybox"><div class="poemcontent">
  <p class="poemtitle">OPPORTUNITY</p>
  <p class="poembody">
    Master of human destinies am I!<br />
    Fame, love, and fortune on my footsteps wait.<br />
    Cities and fields I walk; I penetrate<br />
    Deserts and seas remote, and passing by<br />
    Hovel and mart and palace&mdash;soon or late<br />
    I knock, unbidden, once at every gate!<br />
    If sleeping, wake&mdash;if feasting, rise before<br />
    I turn away.  It is the hour of fate,<br />
    And they who follow me reach every state<br />
    Mortals desire, and conquer every foe<br />
    Save death; but those who doubt or hesitate,<br />
    Condemned to failure, penury, and woe,<br />
    Seek me in vain and uselessly implore.<br />
    I answer not, and I return no more!<br />
  </p>
  <p class="poemauthor">John James Ingalls</p>
</div></div>

<p>
This poem sounded so fatalistic, that it would scare a body to ever sleep.
The second poem was also titled <a href="#onlinenote_opportunitypoems">"Opportunity"</a>, by <a href="#onlinenote_opportunitypoems">Walter Malone</a>.  His
philosophy, I wholeheartedly accepted.
</p>

<p><a href="scans.html?p=99" class="scanlink">93</a></p>

<div class="poetrybox"><div class="poemcontent">
  <p class="poemtitle">OPPORTUNITY</p>
  <div class="poembody">
    They do me wrong who say I come no more<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>When once I knock and fail to find you in;<br />
    For every day, I stand outside your door<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>And bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.<br />
    <br />
    Wail not for precious chances passed away!<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>Weep not for golden ages on the wane!<br />
    Each night I burn the records of the day&mdash;<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>At sunrise every soul is born again!<br />
    <br />
    Dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast?<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>Dost reel from righteous Retribution's blow?<br />
    Then turn from blotted archives of the past<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>And find the future's pages white as snow.<br />
    <br />
    Art thou a mourner?  Rouse thee from thy spell;<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>Art thou a sinner?  Sins may be forgiven;<br />
    Each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell,<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>Each night a star to guide thy feet to Heaven.<br />
    <br />
    Laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped,<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>To vanished joys be blind and deaf and dumb;<br />
    My judgments seal the dead past with its dead,<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>But never bind a moment yet to come.<br />
    <br />
    Though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep;<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>I lend my arm to all who say "I can!"<br />
    No shame-faced outcast ever sank so deep<br />
    <span class="hspace20"></span>But yet might rise and be again a man!

<p>
I felt the exhilaration of weaving my thoughts around those of the
great masters.  I was a shining star with all eyes upon me.  It was too
bad I couldn't have stayed at the podium.  But, like a meteorite crashing
into the forest, I came down onto the floor where benches had been slid
back for the dance.
</p>

<p>
Men from the Pine Creek road camp crowded the dance floor.  The Zion
tunnel was under construction at this time.  Normally, every dance had its
row of wallflowers, but not so this night.  Every girl was popular.  I was
trapped.  One stranger after another took me onto the floor.  The crowd was
my only salvation, because if I got out of step, it could be because someone
else bumped into me.
</p>

<p>
That night, I realized that other things in life were as important as
getting "A's" in school.  I felt like a grub, and longed to be a butterfly.
</p>

<p>
Mama and Papa weren't at the graduation exercises.  They never went
out at nights.  But in some quiet way, they managed to know what was goinq
on.  When I came home from work the day after graduation, I noticed the
pack of cards that my talk had been written on sticking out of Papa's shirt
pocket.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing with those?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
Papa blinked back his tears of pride and grinned.  "I took them to the
bank for Senator Hirschi to read."
</p>

<p>
What a tribute!  Papa considered Dave Hirschi highly intellectual.
If he hadn't liked my talk, he wouldn't have let Dave read it.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=100" class="scanlink">94</a>
With school out, I clerked full time.  The "self-service" system
didn't exist.  Customers asked for each item they wanted, and clerks
s'curried about the store to pick them up.  It was time consuming.  I soon
learned why the clerks detested certain customers.  The only way to keep
from detesting them myself  was to make a project of them.  Whenever the undesirable,
the disagreeable and the ignorant customer came through the
door, I stepped from behind the counter as though tickled to see them.
Amazing!  I discovered that even the grumpiest people were really quite
humorous.
</p>

<p>
Once in awhile, my motives weren't rightly understood, and it brought
the wrong kind of company to our home, and some angry lectures from Papa.
He worried because I was gullible, naive, and too trusting.
</p>

<p>
For example; a certain road camp guy hung around the store too much,
and no one liked him. He was repugnant to me, but I determined to give him
the "glad to see you" routine to see if it worked.  It worked.  Like a
boomerang!  He came to our house one night, just after we had finished
supper.
</p>

<p>
"My name is George," he said, shaking Papa's hand.
</p>

<p>
"My name is George too.  Isom, that is.  Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"George Wickey, and I'm a member of the Church."
</p>

<p>
"What Church?"
</p>

<p>
"Baptist."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't mean a thing to me."
</p>

<p>
"Mind if I sit?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't mind if you do."
</p>

<p>
"Your daughter Alice is a nice girl."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Alice is a nice girl."
</p>

<p>
George and George sat and visited.  They talked about the progress of
the Zion tunnel and whether it was going to be a long, hot summer or not.
(The summer was getting quite stuffy at this point.)
</p>

<p>
"Your daughter Alice is a nice girl," George Wickey repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Alice is a nice girl," Papa agreed.
</p>

<p>
"I came to ask if I could take her to the dance tonight."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like my daughter out in a car with a stranger."
</p>

<p>
"I'm walking.  My friend will pick me up after the dance."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've been gentleman enough to ask my consent.  I'll expect you
to be a gentleman and treat her right and get her home early."
</p>

<p>
Since I'd started this whole thing of being nice to Wickey, I might as
well swallow this bitter pill and go with him.  I went to my room and put on
my pink organdy.  At least he should be safe on foot.  Papa's final admonition
followed us as we walked out the door.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=101" class="scanlink">95</a>
Well, I thought, if we're going to the dance, we're going as fast as
our feet can trot.  I had no notion to linger under the stars with George.
</p>

<p>
"What's your hurry?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"We're late.  Can't you hear the music?"
</p>

<p>
"Come on.  At least we can hold hands."  Clutching one of mine, he
slowed me down.
</p>

<p>
Just before we got to the old shoe shop, he grabbed me in his arms.
When I resisted, he backed me up against Will Ruesch's fence, breathing
on my neck.  "Are you a gold digger?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean someone who goes prospecting out in the hills?" I asked,
pushing him away.
</p>

<p>
"No.  It's a girl who gives a guy something for money," he said,
hugging me.
</p>

<p>
"No I'm not!" I struggled to get away.  He tried to kiss me.  I'd as
soon kiss a toad.  Breaking loose, I ran.  There were lights and people
outside the school house, so I was safe.  Once inside, I squeezed through
the crowd and hid.  Wickey pushed through, craning his neck looking for
me.  As he edged in, I edged out.
</p>

<p>
Overhearing a neighbor say, "Should we run home and check on the kids?"
I asked, "Can I go with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure thing," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
I was home earlier than expected, but Mama and Papa were as relieved
as I.
</p>

<p>
"I was wrong to let you go," Papa admitted, "but there's one thing I
wish you would remember.  You <em>can't</em> be friendly to everyone.  Evil men will
take advantage of you."  He had said this to me a hundred times before.
His message was beginning to sink in.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Most of the customers in the store during the morning hours were
women bringing in their butter and eggs.  We paid for these in store
coupons.  Coupons were considered "women's money", because she was the one
who tended the chickens and who churned the butter.  An egg was as good as
cash.  An egg was a handsome reward to a child for getting his work done.
Little kids came to the store daily, exchanging their one egg for a couple
of sticks of candy.
</p>

<p>
In our town, everybody knew everybody else, and poked fun at each
other's idiosyncrasies.  One family in particular was noted for their
tight-hidedness.  Of the man it was said that he had just got his horses
used to not eating, when they up and died, and that he put green goggles
on his cows so they'd think straw was hay.  And each morning, he gave his
kids a nickel if they'd drink a quart of water before breakfast, and then
charge them a nickel for their dinner.  When he took his wife out for an
automobile ride, she had to lean forward to save gas, and the family had
to jump the fence, to save the gate hinges.  The fact is, they were very
good people and everyone liked them, but the man was more frugal than
normal.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=102" class="scanlink">96</a>
On his wife's birthday, he came to the store with a fist full of her
egg money.  "Shoot," he said, "I've got to get Mariah<a href="#footnote_names" class="footnote">1</a> a present.  I want
to see your enamelware."
</p>

<p>
Enamelware  consisted of cheap metal pots, pans and dishes, glazed
with a gray, blue or white porcelain-like finish  that chipped like glass.
The chipped places rusted.  Enamel dishes were used only at the sheep herd,
in ranch houses, and for camping out, but not at the dinner table at home.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take six plates and six cups.  Mariah is going to be mad as a
hornet, but shoot!  We can't afford the way our kids are breaking dishes."
</p>

<p>
How touching, I thought as I wrapped them, for him to use <em>her</em> egg
money, to buy her a gift that was going to make her mad.  My mind conjured
up a lively scene of Mariah throwing the dishes at him until they were all
chipped, and then the family eating off the hideous things the rest of
their days.
</p>

<p>
Another practical man bought a copper boiler for his wife's birthday.
A copper boiler was an oval-shaped container  made to fit over two holes
on the wood stove, to boil white clothes in  on wash day.  Lifting wet
sheets out of the boiling lye water  with a stick was back breaking.  A
copper boiler was a symbol of drudgery.  A very sentimental birthday gift.
But it tickled me  when this man's wife bought him an axe for his birthday
so he could keep the wood chopped so she could keep her boiler bubbling.
</p>

<p>
Only local, homemade butter was sold in the store.  After the butter
was churned, the excess buttermilk was worked out with a wooden paddle.
The butter was then pressed into a mold, then unmolded onto wet parchment
that was labled with the woman's name, and neatly wrapped.  When
customers sorted through the stacks of butter in the store showcase, it
was like judgment day.  Each woman whose name appeared on the wrapper
was discussed, whether her kitchen was clean or not and whether she tied
a bandana over her hair when she churned.  Some women wore crisp white
aprons over their housedresses when they delivered their butter.  They
advertised their cleanliness, demanded five-cents a pound more for
their butter, and got it.
</p>

<p>
Salley Jones<a href="#footnote_names" class="footnote">1</a> had the reputation of accumulating her cream until it
reeked.  Once a month she'd bring fifteen pounds of butter to the store
in her big water bucket.  Before the days of refrigeration, that was a
lot.  Local customers wouldn't touch it, so naturally, we filled sheepherder
orders with it.  We got a note from one guy out on the Arizona
Strip, saying that the butter we sent him was so strong he had to tie a
rope around it to keep it in camp.
</p>

<p>
Ether Wood hauled freight for Mr. Graff.  Once  when he took his
brother Andrew with him, there was only half enough butter in their grub
box to last for the trip.  So Ether told Andrew that Salley Jones had
made the butter.  Andrew wouldn't touch it, and Ether enjoyed Myra Lemmon's
good sweet cream butter for the entire trip.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Roving gypsy bands occasionally came through Hurricane in the summertime.
People called them dirty horse-traders and thieves, but to me they
were venturesome, carefree and happy.  The women, in their bright scarves
and swirling skirts, were beautiful.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=103" class="scanlink">97</a>
It was a midday in June.  Walter Eagar, Amelia and Jessie Webb,
three of the clerks, had gone home for lunch, when the gypsies arrived.
Mr. Graff and Ruby Ruesch were in the back, marking a shipment of new shoes.
I was alone in the front part of the store  when I saw the gypsies scatter.
A dark-eyed girl came swiftly through the door and behind the counter where
I was dusting.
</p>

<p>
"If you'll cross my palm with silver, I'll tell your fortune."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, but I can't do that," I said uneasily.  I knew the red
folds of silk that covered her were for more than color.  I backed away,
but she moved with me, her eyes riveted on mine  as she kept talking.
She was young, and very pretty.  I was both fascinated and frightened.
It seemed silly to yell for help, but I wished someone&mdash;just <em>anyone</em>,
would come into the store.
</p>

<p>
The girl backed me past a small showcase on top of the counter  that
had the glass door slid open.  Our cash register, a tall, fancy, chrome bedecked
four-drawer one, was under repair, and all of the drawers were
conspicuously open and empty.  In a shoe box, along with the cosmetics in
the open showcase, was the currency, silver and checks.
</p>

<p>
"Cross my palm with just one piece of silver.  There are wonderful
things in store for you," she said, her face upturned to mine.
</p>

<p>
Just then, Mr. Graff materialized, and the gypsy fled.  Reaching
for the shoe box, he found the currency gone.  He ran out the front door
just in time to see the other gypsies help the girl into the back of
their ramshackle truck, which went wheezing down the road.  Quickly, he
summoned Tom Isom, the town marshal, and a posse of men were gathered,
who followed in hot pursuit.
</p>

<p>
The only way out of town was the road going down around the Sulphur
Springs.  It was not a swift road for a fleeing band in a rattle-trap
truck.  The posse blocked their way before they crossed the river.  In
their swift little visit, the gypsies had looted every business house in
town.  The marshal  and his men relieved them of their merchandise and
money, and ordered them never to set foot in Hurricane again.
</p>

<p>
In a council with his clerks, Mr. Graff firmly told us to shout
alarm if ever another gypsy  came into the store.  But the band that fled
from Hurricane that day  seemed to be the last of a vanishing race.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
One day  Mr. Graff said, "Alice, why don't you take my car and run
after the mail?"
</p>

<p>
I had just finished cutting off a slab of bacon for John Sanders.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll go with you," John said.  "I want to go to Will Sullivan's,
so while you're out, maybe you can drop me off at his place."
</p>

<p>
Neither Mr. Graff  nor John knew I had only been behind a steering
wheel once.  I got into the little sports roadster, and John settled down
beside me.  Smartly turning around in the back yard, without knocking over
the trash can, I came out onto the road.  While I tried to recall what
Orval Judd had said about stopping the car, the Post Office appeared.
Driving alongside, I knocked out a fence post, and the wire mesh stopped
us.
</p>

<p>
John was out of the car like he had been rocket-propelled.  "Never
mind about taking me to Will's," he said, "I'll walk."  He didn't even
call for his mail.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=104" class="scanlink">98</a>
I might as well have taken him to Sullivan's.  I drove back to the
store perfectly fine.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Jessie was more experienced at clerking than the rest of us, except
for Walter.  She knew everything from the size of horse-shoe nails, to
how much cloth it took to make a dress for a six year old.  When women
asked for ideas for making a dress, without hesitation, she'd assemble
material on the counter.
</p>

<p>
"I think this cloth would be pretty, with these little buttons down
here, and ribbon and lace around here," etc., designing the dress right
before their eyes.  They always bought what she put before them.
</p>

<p>
One day, when I answered the phone, it was Emma Bradshaw.  "Alice,"
she said, "I want to tie off a comforter this afternoon.  Ira is on his
way to the store now.  Please pick out ten yards of your prettiest cretonne,
and send it home with him."
</p>

<p>
"Jessie," I called, hanging up the phone, "your Aunt Emma wants you
to pick out ten yards of cretonne for her."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Graff overheard me.  With a hand on each of my shoulders, he
asked, "Who did Mrs. Bradshaw ask to pick out that cloth?"
</p>

<p>
Ducking my head, I replied, "Me."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Now go and pick it out."
</p>

<p>
"But I don't know what she will think is pretty."
</p>

<p>
"Go right now and look at that cretonne.  Decide for yourself which is
the prettiest piece, and cut ten yards off from it.  Jessie's choice isn't
one bit better than yours."
</p>

<p>
I'd never thought of that.  Amazed, I looked at the bolts of flowered
material.  They were all pretty, but one piece in particular was much the
prettiest.  Taking it down, I measured it off, and just got it wrapped as
Ira came in the door.
</p>

<p>
A short while later, the phone rang again and I answered it.  "Alice,
this is Emma.  I want to thank you for your picking out such pretty material.
It is exactly what I wanted."  How pleased I was!
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Mr. Graff's home was in LaVerkin, so Walter kept an extra set of keys
to the store in case of emergencies.  The store carried patent medicines,
and every once in awhile, he had to open up in the night for a child
choked up with croup, or for some other ailment.  Going into the store at
night was spooky, because the place was dark.
</p>

<p>
It was just my luck, the one time Walter left the keys with me, I
had to do a lot worse than go after medicine.  Mr. Lewis, who was renting
the two north rooms in our house, died.  The sad weeping of his children,
who were at his bedside, awoke me.  The family realized they had better
travel as far as they could in the cool of the night, to get him to his
old home town for the funeral, so they got me up to go after his casket.
</p>

<p>
If ever I pretended to be brave, it was then.  To go into the far
end of the dungeon where the caskets were, was one thing I never did.
Just the sight of the dusty, pine boxes, conjured up in my mind my childhood
imaginings of the ten caskets of beans in our cellar.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=105" class="scanlink">99</a>
Two of Mr. Lewis's sons went with me, and with a dim flashlight, I
found the light switch inside the back door.  The wooden steps creaked as
we went into the basement.  When I put my hand out to steady myself, the
cement wall was damp and cold.  I had seen the black widows suspended
above their egg balls on the beams overhead, and imagined spider webs entangling
me as I descended.  In the dim light, at the far end of the basement,
the men selected the casket they needed, and we found help in getting
it out.  This incident was merely a dress rehearsal for the one that was to
follow.
</p>

<p>
Soon after that, one of our neighbors died.  In those days, deceased
loved ones were not rushed to a mortuary, but were "laid out" by the
Relief Society sisters.  Ice was brought from the meat market and packed
in fruit jars all around our neighbor to keep her cool until the funeral.
She had been washed and dressed in a pretty white dress, and her hair done
up in a bun on top of her head.  I was asked to sit with her from ten at
night, until two a.m.
</p>

<p>
"Why sit up with someone who is dead?"  I asked. "Mattie<a href="#footnote_names" class="footnote">1</a> isn't going
anywhere is she?"
</p>

<p>
"There have been cases when people were only <em>thought</em> to be dead. If
they gasp for breath, they may need help." Horrified, I looked at the
complacent sister who supplied this information.  "Then of course, we have
to watch for cats," she continued.  I groaned.  "You don't have to worry.
You won't be alone.  Her grandson Elmer will sit with you."
</p>

<p>
Now that was just <em>great</em>! Elmer<a href="#footnote_names" class="footnote">1</a> was one of the ruffians with the corncob
pipe, that had beat up on our sixth grade teacher, and he was always
soused.
</p>

<p>
When I talked to Mama about sitting with the dead, she said, "It is
simply a nice and considerate thing to do.  The family will rest better
knowing you are there."
</p>

<p>
Mattie's bedroom windows were open, and the sheer curtains softly
billowed out into the room.  She lay very still under a white sheet, and
an electric fan droned, vacillating back and forth, at the head of the bed
The breeze from the fan kept lifting the sheet from her hair, until
finally a lock, the size and shape of the tip of a cat's tail, unwound.
It waved back and forth, back and forth with the fan.  I watched, until I
could stand it no longer.  I got up and went out on the front porch, where
Elmer had passed out, dead drunk, in the casket box.  Every time he moved,
his heavy shoes clanked against the pine boards  with a hollow sound.
</p>

<p>
Hot as the night was, I was getting chilled from the melancholy drone
of the fan, and Elmer's mumbling, groaning and clattering in the casket
box.  Suddenly a terrible yowling and shattering of glass  brought me to
my feet in terror.
</p>

<p>
"Elmer, Elmer, wake up," I cried hysterically, shaking him.
</p>

<p>
Groggily he arose.  "Whassa matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Something has happened in there," I choked, pointing inside.
</p>

<p>
I didn't move until he went with me.  Switching on the basement lights,
we saw broken bits of fruit jars strewn down the cement steps.  They ha"
been knocked from the ledge above the steps, where they had been stored.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=106" class="scanlink">100</a>
"Blithering cats," Elmer grunted.
</p>

<p>
Where they came from, or where they went to, I didn't know.  Wild
horses couldn't have dragged me into the basement to find out.  I was ralieved
and happy when two women came to replace me, and I could go home.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Since I was practically the only one to occupy the southwest bedroom
upstairs, I had free rein in fixing it up.  On the floor was a hooked rug
 of my own, original design, and I had appliqued my pillow cases.  The curtains
were some old lace ones, but they looked pretty, freshened up.  Some
of the pictures on the walls were Cloverine salve premiums, and others
were slick, colored magazine pages.  Neither Mama nor Papa ever looked in
my room to say, "How pretty." and everyone else was equally oblivious.  I
was the lone admirer.  It was here that I spent my evenings after work,
cramming on my shorthand and business correspondence, to prepare for
college.  My desk was a shiny, polished table with fancy carved legs, that
I had bought from Graff's.

<p>
The following incident came as natural as breathing.  A business machine
salesman came into the store.  The cut of his suit, the wave of his hair,
the shine of his shoes, the smell of his after-shave lotion, the tone of
his voice and the twinkle in his eye gave me to know that this man was a
gentleman.  Mr. Graff was out, and since I was the one who ran all of his
office equipment, which consisted of an antiquated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Typewriter_Company">Oliver typewriter</a>, and
a hand-crank adding machine, logically I was the one to talk to him.  We
sat in Mr. Graff's office, which was two chairs by a desk in the shoe
room.
</p>

<p>
The conversation got around to my brilliant future in Civil Service,
globe-trotting for Uncle Sam.  The handsome salesman seemed interested,
throwing out lead questions to let me know that we were kindred spirits.
I had no romantic illusions toward him.  He was simply part of summer, like
new mown hay, or the magazine pictures on my bedroom wall.
</p>

<p>
I suddenly remembered there was a catch in my typewriter that needed
fixing.  I asked him if he could do it, and he said he could.  "I'll finish
my business calls, and be back to pick you up at closing time," he said.
Closing time came at dusk, and he was waiting in front as I came out the
door.
</p>

<p>
At home, suppertime was at dusk.  For some reason, regardless of the
season, the family could never eat supper in daylight.  As I came in the
door with my friend, there sat the family around the big table in the
living room, eating their bread, milk, and fruit.  Although the table cloth
was fresh and white, suddenly the room, the table and the family looked so&mdash;
so&mdash; &mdash;my conscience smarted to even dare think it&mdash;so back-woodsy.
</p>

<p>
Papa always took too lively an interest in anyone we brought home, and
heaped them with questions.  I hurried the salesman past him as quickly as
possible, with only a brief introduction, explaining that he had come to
fix my typewriter.  I ushered him into the kitchen and up the narrow stairs
to my room.
</p>

<p>
Oh dear!  The room that had seemed so charming this morning, now
suddenly diminished in my eyes, and looked hicky.  The man sat down to my
beautiful table to look at Oscar.  Oscar was the typewriter.  He ran the
carriage back and forth, flipped a few levers and said the machine was now
in perfect order.  He was too kind to say there was nothing wrong with it.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=107" class="scanlink">101</a>
"It just needed a little tuning up," he said.
</p>

<p>
Just as he leaned back in his chair to visit, Wayne came in and sat on
my bed, making a nest in the sagging mattress that I had patted out so
carefully.  I could tell by his sunburned grin, that showed his front teeth
that were too big for his face, that he was settled down to stay.  No way
could I have a heart-to-heart talk with this magnificent man with this
little pest around, so there was nothing left to do but thank him for
coming, and lead him back downstairs.
</p>

<p>
Graciously he said goodnight to the family.  Then came the explosion.
"It is disgraceful, sinful, and immoral to take a strange man to your
bedroom," Papa shouted, his face a livid red.
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing wrong with taking a repairman to fix my typewriter,"
I hotly defended.
</p>

<p>
"I want it understood that when your typewriter needs fixing, you will
do it downstairs on this table."
</p>

<p>
"You know I can't lug that heavy thing down the stairs," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"You've done it plenty of times," he reminded me.
</p>

<p>
"But the family was eating supper."
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't make any difference.  He could sit on the lounge and
wait until we cleared a place."
</p>

<p>
Oh sure, sure.  I could see it all&mdash;what with Papa bombarding him
about his morals and religion.
</p>

<p>
"Only a cheap, loose woman would take a man to her bedroom," he stormed.
</p>

<p>
"Papa!" I burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"This is what Isaiah meant when he talked about the daughters of Zion,"
he continued, and I knew exactly what he was going to quote.
</p>

<p>
I ran to my room and plopped onto my face, crying a puddle of tears on
Grandmother's crazy-patch quilt.  How could a family be so unimaginative and
lacking in understanding!  Not one of them knew the least thing about how a
girl felt.
</p>

<p>
Softly, Mama came into my room and put her arms around me.  "You'd
better come and get some supper, Patsy," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I don't want any," I blubbered.
</p>

<p>
"Don't feel so bad," she coaxed.  "Your father is right.  There are so
many things that will look differently to you later on.  Come on down and
be with the family."
</p>

<p>
I began to feel that Mama did understand.  I knew I had to face the
family, so I went down with her.
</p>

<p>
Penitently, Papa said, "I'm sorry I was so harsh."  Tears stood in his
eyes.  "It is because we love you, and we know you are too innocent," he
explained.
</p>

<p>
The next day, when the salesman returned to talk to Mr. Graff, I got so
busy with customers that I didn't have to face him.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=108" class="scanlink">102</a>
A certain customer, who always bought laundry soap, really turned my
generator on when he entered the store.  Even if I was fitting boots on
the Prince of Wales, I think I would have left him in the shoe room if
Winferd Gubler appeared.  But about all the response I ever got from
Winferd was his money when he paid for the soap.  The rest of the clerks
knew I had a crush on him, so they left him for me to wait on.
</p>

<p>
Winferd managed the swimming pool at the LaVerkin Hot Springs.  The
soap was to launder the towels and swim suits.  I figured if he ever dated
a girl, she would have to be a princess, so the most I could hope for was
his smile as I bagged up his Fels-Naptha and Crystal White soap.
</p>

<p>
My dating, for most of the summer, was "gang" dating, which took us
often to the swimming pool.  I couldn't swim, but usually sat on the steps
dangling my feet in the water.  Sometimes, I sat on a bench, and if Winferd
wasn't busy, he sat and visited with me.
</p>

<p>
One evening, just before I left for college, he said, "Alice, you're
too nice a girl to be running around with this kind of company.  You're
cheapening yourself, so that the right kind of fellow wouldn't want to
date you."
</p>

<p>
Stunned, I looked at him.  <em>He</em> was the one I'd rather date than anyone
in the world, but he never condescended to ask me.  The kids in the gang
always came for me.  There was nothing wrong with them, except they had a
bottle once in awhile. But they knew better than to offer it to me.
</p>

<p>
"How kind of you, Mr. Alligator," I retorted.
</p>

<p>
"Alice, I mean it," he said earnestly.  "Don't sell yourself short."
</p>

<p>
I could see that he <em>did</em> mean it, and somehow I wasn't angry with him.
But now, summer was over, and the gang split up.  I never saw them again.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Ah College!  The Grand Old BAC!  Kate was the Fairy Godmother who
whisked me there.  For the first two weeks, we stayed with Aunt Evadna and
Uncle John Hopkins.  I planned to become a fine School Teacher, and words
of praise would dribble back to Mama and Papa about me, like they did
about Kate.  But Uncle John changed that.
</p>

<p>
"Alice, don't register for normal training," he said.  "There are too
many old-maid school teachers already.  You may not even be able to get a
contract.  And even if you do, you'll spend your life teaching your school
mates' little kids.  That's no way to catch a husband.  Go into business
where you'll be working with adults."
</p>

<p>
He made sense, so I changed my course on registration day.  The day
before, Kate took me to Henry Berkstrom's exclusive shop, where she bought
me an entire wardrobe of beautiful, beautiful dresses.  The fabrics were
rich and the tailoring superb.  Transformed, I was as sharp looking as any
co-ed on campus.  I blossomed under the touch of her magic wand.
</p>

<p>
One thing was lacking.  I was <em>not</em> transformed into a divine dancer.
I was something less than Cinderella at the registration dance.  But the
Prince was there, in person of Lyle Thomas, the best looking, curly-headed
football player at the BAC.  As I entered, clipping along in my smart,
patent leather slippers, elegant dress, and soft windblown hairdo, he saw
me.  With the first strains of music, he grandly glided, swirling and
<a href="scans.html?p=109" class="scanlink">103</a>
bowing, the full length of the mirror-bright floor, swooping me off my
feet.  Literally off my feet!  Stark terror gripped me, and the room spun.
When Lyle almost stumbled with the frozen icicle (me) in his arms, he
hastily returned me to my seat.  He never looked at me again.  The miracle
of the incident is that I didn't run home crying.  I stayed and watched
all evening.  Self-consciousness turned to indignation.  I resolved to
learm to dance.
</p>

<p>
For the next two weeks. Cedar City lay shivering under wet, black
clouds.  New clothes, the college campus, school activities&mdash;nothing,
could stay the longing for home that built up inside of me.  All I could
think of was how nice and sunny it must be at home.  I developed a toothache
and needed to see old Doc Gibson.  That was reason enough to go home.
</p>

<p>
Saturday morning, I walked down Cedar Main, with my little suitcase.
I couldn't find a soul from home.  At Petty Motors I inquired, "Do you
happen to have a car going to Hurricane?"
</p>

<p>
"Can you drive?" Charlie Petty asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," I answered.  I was homesick enough to drive anything going
my way.
</p>

<p>
"I've just sold a car to Chester<a href="#footnote_names" class="footnote">1</a> and Albert<a href="#footnote_names" class="footnote">1</a>, and they don't drive.
Can you chauffeur them?"
</p>

<p>
"I sure can," I replied.
</p>

<p>
Chester and Albert were timid bachelors from Rockville.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the shiny cars, I asked, "Which one is yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Ours is out back," Chester answered, and I followed him into the
garage.
</p>

<p>
A mechanic was under the hood.  Slamming it down as we approached,
he said, "Your little jewel is ready for the road."
</p>

<p>
At my startled look, Albert said, "We got it for twenty-five dollars.
We ain't goin' to drive anywhere only around in the field."
</p>

<p>
The car was a faded blue.  The interior resembled a mouse's nest with
cotton oozing from splits in the upholstery.  I was thankful the mechanic
backed it out of the garage, because I'd never driven in reverse.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yep," Chester replied, getting into the front seat.
</p>

<p>
I slid under the steering wheel and Albert got in the back. I pushed
the starter button, the car coughed and puffed a cloud of black smoke, I
put it in gear, and we chugged out of town.  Every time I gave it the gas,
the car shimmied, so I eased it down to a crawl.  It was better for me, for
I still wasn't used to steering.
</p>

<p>
Except for the rumble of the motor, we traveled in silence.  I looked
at Chester.  He had gone rigid, with his back stiffened against the seat,
his feet pushing against the floorboard, and his eyes glued to the road.
When I turned to see how Albert was, he made a startled, choking sound, and
sat up tall, to watch the road while I looked at him.  I couldn't see why
they were so scared.  There was no speedometer, but we couldn't possibly
<a href="scans.html?p=110" class="scanlink">104</a>
have been doing twenty-five miles per hour.  If we had gone faster, the car
would have been shaken to pieces.
</p>

<p>
Well, if they wanted to go into a coma, that was up to them, but this
was my first time driving on the open road, and I was going to enjoy it.
My tooth didn't ache anymore because I was going home.  Happily I hummed,
"Mid pleasures and palaces," and the little car jerked and twitched over
the Black Ridge, out of the clouds, and down into the sunshine of our little
corner of the earth.  I knew Albert and Chester were still breathing, for
occasionally I heard one or the other gasp.
</p>

<p>
A new road was under construction between Toquerville and LaVerkin
and I almost missed the right-angle turn.  When my eye caught the detour,
I made it so sudden and sharp that it took the car a few feet to get
back on all fours.  I had planned on driving clear home, but at the take-off
to Rockville, Chester said, "You'd better stop here."
</p>

<p>
"Stop?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  We don't want to go no further.  You get out and we'll take the
car home."
</p>

<p>
Well! Talk about appreciation, after all I'd brought them through.
I was still four miles from home!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Graff came along and stopped just as Albert set my suitcase by
the side of the road.  For the first time, those old bachelors came alive.
I had thought they were dead to any feeling, but with me out of their car
they radiated.  Enthusiastically they thanked me, over and over, for bringing
them this far.  Mr. Graff whisked me off for home.  As I looked back,
Albert and Chester were waving goodbye.
</p>

<p>
Monday morning, Ether Wood brought me back to school.  Ether freighted
for Mr. Graff, and waited on all of the college students from Hurricane.
He transported them, and brought packages from their mothers, cheerfully
and without pay.  (He filled Papa's coa1 bin without pay, and always checked
to see if there was bottled fruit to be sent to us.)
</p>

<p>
Our apartment in the Will Simpkins home was ready, and we moved in
with our cousins Lula and LaVerna Heaton.  Their brother Freddie lived
with Aunt Kate and Uncle Will Palmer.  Freddie and his friend, Lovell,
used to visit us.  Since we were all duds at dancing, we set up a class
m our living room.  Day after day, we danced to the music of Lula's
phonograph, until we gained confidence enough to tackle the school dances.
</p>

<p>
"It's turning that gets me out of step," Freddie confessed.  "The
easiest way is to bump into someone at each corner of the room, then
turn my partner while I'm already out of step."
</p>

<p>
One night at a school social, I was dancing with Lovell. The floor
was slick, and he slipped.  Afraid we'd both go down, I let go of him, and
landed on his back.  I felt so terribly sorry, because I knew exactly
how he felt.
</p>

<p>
Social prestige on campus came with membership in a sorority or fraternity.
Initiation into these clubs was one of the highlights to a
"freshie".  Initiations ranged from the dangerous to the ridiculous.  The
Nu Omega Rho Sorority made a bid for me.  For the three weeks of my initiation,
I carried a brick with "goat" written on it.  The brick was heavy,
but I was never to lay it down.  Each day at school, one of my "superiors"
<a href="scans.html?p=111" class="scanlink">105</a>
made a goat out of me.  One day I had to wear my graduation dress to school,
along with a pair of knee-high hiking boots, and an alarm clock dangling
around my neck.  The alarm went off during English class, and Mr. Hayward
said, "Alice, you may leave the room."  So with rhinestones flashing, pink
georgette fluttering and heavy boots clopping, I made my "inconspicious" exit.
Always, we had to do the mortifying thing requested of us, for we were
spied upon by our "superiors".
</p>

<p>
All of the Nu Omega Rho "goats" had to plead poverty, and beg their
way into the movie.  We were humiliated and ridiculed by the manager, but
finally admitted.  (Our tickets had previously been paid for.)  Lorna
Lowe and I had to order a meal at Lunt's Cafe, then slip out without paying.
We were grabbed, and sent to the kitchen to do dishes.  We knew this
was rigged, because they had saved up mountains of dirty dishes.  We washed
all afternoon.
</p>

<p>
After three weeks of embarrassing, humiliating experiences, we were
taken to our final court at midnight, blindfolded, and led into a dark
room.  We were pushed from upper-story windows, burned with red hot pokers
and fed gritty, raw oysters.  All of this was phony, except the oysters.
The power of suggestion was supposed to make us feel we were falling when
we were caught in a net, and ice was supposed to feel red-hot. It was a
disappointment, because things seemed like what they really were.
</p>

<p>
But I became a sworn-in Nu Omega Rho, and was given a red silk
handkerchief, with the insigne in the corner.  This was my first (and last)
step up the social ladder.  I was too blithe a spirit to be a good Nu
Omega Rho.  Sophistication bored me.
</p>

<p>
To gain prestige, the Omegas made a grand splash for Mrs. Jack London,
when she came to town.  They fixed up the college social hall, renting an
upholstered set from Hunter Hardware, along with a crystal punch bowl and
other dishes, a polished table and lace cover.  They bought "frappe",  an
exciting new frozen dessert, and cakes.  Mrs. London graciously spent an
hour with us.  The party cost each club member $5.00 apiece, at a time
when bread was 5&cent; a loaf!  Mrs. London never did get her husband to dedicate
a book to us, and even after the financial drain, which hurt  we
scarcely made the news.
</p>

<p>
The college kept an honor roll posted in the front entrance of Old
Main.  I was surprised when I saw my name next to the top.  That challenged
me.  Why not get it on the very top?  I dug in and made it, but keeping it
there was something else.  I kept my name on the honor roll all year, but
the top spot was shared.
</p>

<p>
My one diversion from the heavy courses I took, was an art class from
Bastow.  To help pay expenses, I worked in the combined Creamery and Book
Store a couple of hours each afternoon, under Hazen Cooley.  My homesickness
had vanished.
<p>

<p>
When we went home for Thanksgiving, I slept with LaPriel.  Thanksgiving
morning, LaPriel awoke with the mumps!
</p>

<p>
Back at school, I enrolled in a dancing class under Ballentyne.  Joyously,
I looked forward to the Christinas dance at home.  I had a strong premonition
that Winferd Gubler would <em>really</em> see me for the first time.  Of
all the guys on the college campus, there was <em>no one</em> to compare with Winferd!
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=112" class="scanlink">106</a>
Christmas morning, <em>I</em> awoke with the mumps!  Fat and ugly.  I was too
sick to join the family downstairs, and too sick to care.  Late that night
Edith came home giggling.  She had been out with that funny Winferd Gubler.
Funny?  There was nothing funny about it to me.  It was tragic!  I would
have given the world to be with him.  Now, I was <em>really</em> sick.  Sick with
total frustration!
</p>

<p>
I spent the entire holidays in bed, barely getting over the mumps in
time to return to school.  I had lost fifteen pounds.
</p>

<p>
At quarterly conference held in December, the St. George Stake was
divided, and the Zion Park Stake was organized, with Claude Hirschi as

      The two poems titled "Opportunity" that Alice quotes in her original typewritten book are
      slightly different than they appear in <i><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/littleamerpoems00rittrich">The Little Book of American Poets</a></i> on pages 239 through 241.
      </p>
      <p>
      Alice's original manuscript moves a few stanzas of the second poem around.  And a few words and punctuation choices differ as well.  Alice also attributes the second poem to Robert B. Malone instead of the correct Walter Malone.  It could be that her source for both poems was different.
      </p>
      <p>
      Perhaps Alice compiled the quotes in her book from her original notes from 1929.  No matter what the reason, this note is here to alert readers that the poems have been adapted in this online presentation to match them as they appear in the book <i>The Little Book of American Poets</i> (a version of which was very likely Alice's original source).

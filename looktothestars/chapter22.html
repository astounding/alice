With the New Year came the snow, which clung stubbornly to the shady slopes of the canyon, and capped the dugway to Hurricane with ice. One morning as we started up the dugway, an old fellow hailed us, so Winferd kindly stopped to pick him up. The grade was too steep and slick. Our car wheels spun, and we skidded into the barpit, stalling three other cars behind us. The drivers all got out to push and help each other, but the old fellow who was the cause of it all, hobbled out of our car and mumbled, "I might as well be walking on." Finally, when all of the cars got traction enough to crawl up the hill, the old man tried to hail a ride again, but no one stopped.
</p>

<p>
Winter concentrated itself in the canyon, but the snow melted in the sun-swept fields up town. Winferd plowed the garden and excavated a basement for our house. The excavating was done with a fresno (scraper) and a horse. Neighbors traded work for swim cards.
</p>

<p>
I stayed to tend the business, which was so slow I had time to explore every nook of the shadow-trapped canyon. On the shortest days, the first rays of the sun reached the house at 10:00 a.m. and were gone by 3:00 p.m. Five hours of sunshine was not enough. The pipe line remained frozen, so hauling water became routine.
</p>

<p>
When the ice finally melted, little green things pushed up through the wet sod and the sun at last traveled above the south rim of the hill. Still, we had no water. Surely no ice could remain in the pipes in such weather, I thought, so I followed along the pipeline to investigate. There, just barely on <em>our side</em> of the meter, was a stream oozing into the ground where the pipe had burst. We could have had water long before, if only we had checked.
</p>

<p>
When the marshal made his six-month's reading, he gave us a water bill for $110.00.
</p>

<p>
"But we haven't had a drop of water for three months," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"That's too bad. The water was delivered to your meter. The bill has <em>got</em> to be paid."
</p>

<p>
"Look," I cried, "if the town had buried their part of the pipe, we wouldn't have been frozen out."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you folks want to sit this out in jail, that's up to you," he said.
</p>

<p>
Luckily for us, Hurricane changed marshals at this time. Wilson Imlay became the new marshall. He walked along the pipeline with, and then said, "Would you pay $10 for water used?"
</p>

<p>
Would we! We were happy to. His kindness was greatly appreciated.

Grandmother Crawford passed away on April 13, at the age of eighty-two. I felt that she died of homesickness. Less than two years before, Zion National Park had extended its boundary line to encompass all of Oak Creek.
<a href="scans.html?p=137" class="scanlink">127</a>
The house that Grandfather had built, as well as the homes of my uncles and cousins, were torn down. Although Grandfather had been gone for twenty years, Grandmother had kept his memory alive with touches of his personal belongings here and there about the sunny bright home he had built. How she loved and cherished every reminder of him, and now, she had been literally torn away from the one spot on earth that she held most dear. The little new house that was built for her in Springdale was never home to her. It seemed that it would have been a pitifully small thing for the Park Service to have let her remain in her home until her mortal life was through.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
One day LaPriel tended the pool, while Winferd and I scouted the Pine Valley foothills in search of building sand.
</p>

<p>
"A herd of sheep has recently passed this way," Winferd observed.
</p>

<p>
Just then, we heard a plaintive little cry, so we followed the sound up a wash. There alone, among the scrub oak, was silky white baby goat. Kneeling, I held my hand out coaxingly. I was wearing a white wool sweater, and the little kid quickly saw the resemblance between me and his mother. Dainty-footed he came, nuzzling and whimpering into my sweater.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please Winferd, can I have him?" I coaxed.
</p>

<p>
"You're asking for trouble," he protested.
</p>

<p>
"Please. We can't leave him here alone," I begged.
</p>

<p>
The little goat's tail flitted back and forth, as his head bunted and begged.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, alright," Winferd surrendered. "You're both too much for me."
</p>

<p>
Well! That little billy goat was the most sociable critter that ever lived at a public swimming pool. He adopted everyone and everything, cars included. No car was too slick or shiny for his prancing hooves. The number of vehicles we had to wash became mortifying.
</p>

<p>
"We've got to get rid of that goat," Winferd complained.
</p>

<p>
We had lots of takers, but I couldn't part with him. Early one morning, Winferd announced with a grin, "Billy won't bother us today."
</p>

<p>
"What happened?" I asked suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"He's in a good safe place."
</p>

<p>
Leading me out the door, he pointed to a ledge above the swimming pool. There on a little shelf, the goat looked down at us, plaintively bleating.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Winferd," I exclaimed, "we can't leave him there."
</p>

<p>
"Why not? It's a good place for him," he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Please get him down," I begged.
</p>

<p>
"It's a perfectly proper place for a goat," he said. "When he gets ready, he'll figure out how to get down, the same way he got up."
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=138" class="scanlink">128</a>
Surveying the situation, I could see that if the goat jumped he'd kill himself. While Winferd cleaned the dressing rooms, I climbed above the ledge and let myself down onto the shelf beside the goat. I had intended to get hold of him and boost him on top. Much to my distress, I found the shelf too narrow for me to stoop. I'd fall over the edge if I tried it. The goat was so tickled to have company that he wiggled against me, almost knocking us both off. Digging my fingers in the cracks of the rocks, I screamed for help.
</p>

<p>
Winferd came out of the building, and seeing our predicament, bounded up the hillside. Standing above the little cliff where we were trapped, he looked down at us. I was so scared I whimpered almost as pitifully as the goat.
</p>

<p>
"You're a fine pair," Winferd panted.
</p>

<p>
After pulling me onto safe footing, he reached down and got the goat. His sense of humor was maddening. He chuckled all the way down the hill.
</p>

<p>
Homer and Joe Englestead came for a swim, and when Joe said, "I'll give you a dime for that goat," Winferd said, "I'll take it."
</p>

<p>
Tickled over the deal, Joe took the little fellow in her arms as she got in the car to leave. "You precious little darling," she cooed.
</p>

<p>
Homer started the moter and Joe said, "Oh, oh," raising the goat up from her lap. A steaming puddle glistened on her black satin skirt.
</p>

<p>
Laughing uproariously as Homer, Joe and the goat drove out of sight, Winferd said, "What shall we do with the dime?"
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
In the evenings, Winferd drew house plans with as much zeal as if he had money to
execute them. Digging a hole for a basement was one thing, but building was
another&mdash;especially without cash. But optimistically he planned. Our contract
to run the pool would soon be up.

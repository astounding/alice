<span class="entrydate">January 1.</span>  HAPPY NEW YEAR!  Ermal arose with the spirit of celebrating,
resolved to watch the Cotton Bowl and the Rose Bowl parade on TV.  And I
resolved <em>not</em> to be sidetracked, no matter how many times he called,
"Hey, hon, come look at this float," because every time I rush to his summons,
he says, "Oh, you're too late."
</p>

<p>
The year begins on Saturday, so I determined to give the place a quick
slickup, because Ruby and Roland are calling for us at ten.  We have a date
with them.
</p>

<p>
Well, my poor spouse!  He has flipped the TV on and off with much
lamenting and murmuring.  "There's <em>nothing</em> but school bands, and all that
yacking and chit chat between the announcers."  Between the flipping the
switch on and off he has paced the floor.  He might as well have had a dust
cloth in his hands while he paced around.  Finally the Rose Parade really
began and he settled down to his constant calling, "Hon, this is a pretty
one, come see."  Or, "Hon, you gotta see this one."  I gratified him by
sticking my head in once in a while.  But I just barely got the place slicked
up when the Webbs called for us.
</p>

<p>
We headed for Mesquite to have dinner at the Western Village.  roland
stopped at the hospital in St. George, and I ran to see Marilyn.  She
was 100% better.  I was happy to see that she was her old smiley self.
</p>

<p>
At Beaver Dam we turned off the road and went up a little draw to where
Harold Blackmore and his two wives Gwen and Florence were working on their
underground house.  The wives hugged all four of us, although I'd never seen
them before.  They made me feel like I was a dear old relative, and Harold
gave us a big, hearty handshake.
</p>

<p>
The underground house is really on top of the ground, but built back
against a hillside, with dirt scraped up on two sides and partly on top.
Gwen and Florence were full of talk, witty and lively as crickets.  Gwen
gave us each a bag of fresh, raw peanuts.  I think I never stopped chuckling
while we were there.
</p>

<p>
Western Village was full of people who heaped too much food on their
plates because they could get all they could eat for $3.49.  We saw many
folks from home.
</p>

<p>
On our way home we toured Bloomington and Santa Clara Heights.  This,
that was a barren desert so short a time ago, is newly landscaped and
occupied with many elegant homes.
</p>

<p><span class="entrydate">January 2.</span> The first fast Sunday of the year.  I made some New Year's
resolutions.  One of them was not to be such a weakling when it comes to fasting.  I'll confess, that in all
of my 72 years, I've secretly not hailed fast day with oy.  I'd get gaunt just thinking about it.  We're supposed
to fast with a purpose, so today, I fasted and prayed that I'd enjoy fasting.  And I really did.
</p>

<p>
We went to the hospital with Donworth.  When we got there, Marilyn was
visiting in Harriet's room.  Harriet has pneumonia.  Marilyn will be released
tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<a href="view.html#scan=756" class="scanlink">736</a>
<span class="entrydate">January 3.</span>  My new visiting teacher partner, Ora Morrill and I got the
new year started out right.  Our visiting teaching is done.  Our families
are Pearl Allen, Betty Owens, and Anna Mae Halterman.  Ermal went to the
hospital and brought Marilyn home while we were out.
</p>

<p>
This afternoon, my teachers came.  They are Pam Lind and Joy Gubler.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 4.</span>  John brought Clayton with him to our house tonight and
showed us his slides of Uruguay.  It makes me appreciate our living conditions.
But John says those people are happy with their life style.
</p>

<p>
Marilyn and I visited until midnight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 5.</span>  Chance made a hydraulic wood-splitter for DeMar.  I watched
as he split big saw logs as easily as if they were chips.  Chance is very
resourceful.  He can create anything that can be done in welding and mechanics.
</p>

<p>
DeMar's little baby, Crystal Lynn stood fascinated watching the splitter.
Hwerever DeMar is, Crystal wants to be.  And DeMar is flattered by
her devotion.  He adores her.  She runs into his arms every time he comes home.
</p>

<p>
Having Marilyn with us is a joy.  Tonight John, Kelly, Clayton, Mimsi, Helen and DeMar came to see
Kathy's slides and to her her Christmas tape.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 6.<span>  Leon says, "I just <em>love</em> Aunt Marilyn, because she's interested
in everything I'm interested in."  He brought a magazine advertising fancy chickens to show her.  They decied to
go into business together.  She will order the baby chicks, and Leon will raise them out for half.
</p>

<p>
Leon has 30 baby chicks in their furnace room now that he hatched out from 30 eggs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">Jan. 7.</span> Convalescing is taxing Marilyn's patience.  She wants to be up
and doing, but doesn't have the vitality.  "I want to make an apricot cobbler," she said.
</p>

<p>
So Ermal, Marilyn, and I made a united-effort-apricot-cobbler.  Marilyn wrote down the recipe, and supervised
and measured.  I gathered the material around her, heated the oven, and greased the pans.  Ermal stirred the
batter and licked the bowl.  We made two cobblers, because Marilyn wanted to give one to Uncle Ovando.
</p>

<p>
Shirley and Lolene and their little ones had dinner with us.  Later DeMar and Helen joined us.
</p>

<p>This evening, while Ermal went with Horatio to a priesthood session in
the temple, Marilyn and I took the cobbler to Edna and Ovando.  There was
hugging and laughing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 8.</span>  Chance too Marilyn home today.  Our place seems empty.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 10.</span>  My Holy Ghost story was returned from The Friend with
suggest alterations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 11.</span>  WE bought our new scriptures today, and we're all excited
about them.  I re-wrote my story and returned it to the Friend.  I like this
version more than the original one.
</p>

<p>
LaPriel and Jim returned from their month long vacation in Hawaii.
There's a volcano going on over there that has been spewing lava for days.
<a href="view.html#scan=757" class="scanlink">737</a>
In November, the islands had a devastating hurricane and tidal waves.  Jim's and LaPriel's vacation was sandwiched in between.
</p>

<p>
LeGrand Richards, our beloved apostle, died today. He was almost 97.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 12.</span>  Ermal and I went to town board meeting tonight to see if any relief was coming from the cloud of dust that hangs over our town.  I have to hose off the Rambler each time, before I drive it.  Dust is so bad, that if I don't hose off the car, within five days it begins to slide in ÅŸheets down the glass. Thera'es no need for a blade of grass, or a green leaf to grow, or a flower to bloom under this pall.
</p>

<p>
At the meeting, they told us that eventually the roads would be fixed.  How eventually, they do not know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 13.</span> Paulette was our little girl until time for the noon bus.  I wanted desperately to write.  It seems like something comes up every day so I can't.  So I left Paulette in front of TV and came to my room.
</p>

<p>
My conscience said, "Shame on you.  It's seldom that you have a little granddaughter with you. What's an hour and a halfin terms of eternity? Don't leave her in front of TV."
</p>

<p>
I approached her. "Paulette, which would you rather do, go for a walk or watch TV?"
</p>

<p>
"Watch TV." She never took her eyes off from it.
</p>

<p>
I returned to my typewriter.  Then Paulette shouted, "It'soff!"  So was my typewriter.  The power was off.  So we went for a walk,
</p>

<p>
We went above the canal, along the hillside to the tunnel, then down the road past Devar Gubler's.  DeVar's big black dog joined us.  He was feeling foxy.  He'd growl and scratch up the earth, then trot ahead a bit and do it again.  At Gaye Lynn's, little dogs met us and tumbled with the big black dog.
</p>

<p>
"Go home, Herm, this isn't your territory," Gaye Lynne said.
</p>

<p>
We just got home in time to make a peanut butter sandwich with <em>red</em> jelly on it, before the school bus came.  After school, Paulette was at the door wanting to take the same walk again, but I was scrubbing the kitchen.  She stayed for supper and I walked her home and told her the names of the few stars I knew. The sky fascinated her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 15.</span> Tomorrow is my sister Annie's 80th birthday. Today Alene had an open house for her.  Annie was radiant--simply beautiful.  Her pink dress accentuated the pink in her cheeks.  She has the face of an angel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 16.</span> Dennis and Sandy had a baby boy born today (McKay). Ermal and I were guests of the second ward Primary on their sharing time this morning.  I told the children the story of the Primary children fasting and praying for Ermal's grandmother when she was blind, and of her sight being restored.
</p>

<p>
Having our families around us livens up our days.  DeMar drops in often to share a hot muffin he has just baked, or a tape of music he especially enjoys, or a picture, or a joke in a magazine.  Always he has a little girl or two with him.  He plays Paulette's make-believe games with her when she hides under the table.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy, where am I?" she'll call.
</p>

<p>
You're in a doll house," he answers.
</p>

<p>
<a href="view.html#scan=758" class="scanlink">738</a>
"Nope."
</p>

<p>
"You're in a castle."
</p>

<p>
"Nope."
</p>

<p>
"You're in the apple tree," etc.  Finally, he slides her out by her feet,
tickles her stomach, and says, "Come on mischief.  We've got to go."
</p>

<p>
Vaughn comes selling the Grit and stops to visit.  Leon comes with a
rooster under his arm to discuss his meat-growing project.  His 30 little
chicks are living in his outdoor fireplace with a light bulb in it.
</p>

<p>
I listen as Lolene reads her letter to the editor of the Spectrum
about rotten movies, and Shirley calls to see how we are, and over the
phone Susanna says, "Hello, Grandma."  Our families are what really count.
</p>

<p>
The exhaust from the chain saw melted the leg of Ermal's polyester
pants.  When he felt his leg burning, he moved the saw.  I was sick of that
pair of pants anyway.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 17.</span>  Dana wonders how she ever deserved a little tyke
like Shannon.  Today, after she bathed and dressed her, the phone rang before
she emptied the baby's tub.  Shannon climbed back in, shoes and all.
</p>

<p>
Scott left his bedroom door open when he went to school, and the
bottom drawer of his bureau was left open.  Shannon climbed into the drawer
and the bureau tipped over on top of her.  The fish aquarium, which was on
top of the chest of drawers, crashed to the floor, breaking glass everywhere.
Shannon screamed.  She was pinned under the drawers with the broken aquarium
on one arm.  Gravel, water, and flopping fish were on the floor.  Dana is
ready to go on vacation.
<p>

<p>
Ermal fixed LaPriel's sewing machine, and tonight Jim brought a lemon pie
with whipped cream on it with her thanks.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 24.</span> A letter came today from John R. Ward, M.D., Professor
of Medicine, Chief, Division of Rheumatolog.  This was in response to my letter to the University
of Utah about my wonderful release from arthritis ater I had been to Salt Lake for mouth surgery.
</p>

<p>
He says, "In terms of your response to penicillin after your root canal
procedures, I noticce that you were given dexamethasone, a cortisone derivative. &hellip; It is
my prediction that once the dexamethasone is discontinued that you will have a flare in your arthritis.
</p>

<p>"It is clearly demonstrated that cortisone derivatives are effective in
controlling the symptoms of many forms of arthritis but are associated with some potential severe
side effects if continued in high doses for prolonged periods of time. &hellip;"
</p>

<p>
I appreciate very much his kind letter and the information which is certainly correct.  My total
freedom from arthritis has already vanished.
</p>

<p>
I returned Wayne's laundry tonight, and Lapriel will take over again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 27.</span>  Ermal is talking about trading the van for a motor home.
I'm simply <em>not</em> interested.  I told him I'd much prefer a car that I can drive with comfort.
The Rambler is a beast, when it comes to shifting gears, sometimes balking badly when I try to get it into second.
The Armstrong steering is pretty bad, when the arm isn't strong.  I <em>need</em> power steering.  The Rambler has been sun-baked for 18 years and is falling apart.
</p>

<p>
<a href="view.html#scan=759" class="scanlink">739</a>
<span class="entrydate">January 28.</span> This morning I put on a pot of chicken backs, necks, wings, gizzards, and hearts.  I explained to Ermal that I was going to
simmer off some broth, so I could make some exotic onion soup, like Sister
moRrill demonstrated in Relief Society.  Well, my hearty husband didn't listen to me.  When I got home, he ahad dinner on.  He had dumped noodles into that pot of bones!  It looked quite revolting.
</p>

<p>
He had also steamed parsnips.  His crop this year is the smoothest,
whitest, biggest, sweetest parsnips he has ever raised.  And we have
parsnips three times a day.  That's how our menus go.  When the green
corn is on, we have corn three times a day.  When the squash is on, we eat
squash three times a day.  We eat one thing until its cycles is finished.  Ermal
grows it, and fixes it, and bursts with joy at the fruits of his labors.
And I love, and adore, and endure him.
</p>

<p>
Lolene, Kendall Paul, and Shauna ate with us.  Lolene proof-read 60 pages of my book for me.  Today was her top production.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 30.</span> Scott Stratton was ordained a deacon today.  Roger came
with Corinne to be there for the event, and then he came to "play" with Grandma and Grandpa.  He
played two tunes on the zither, then opened the Jumpins game and fiddled
with it about two minutes.  He decided to read story books.  It took him five minutes to read the
whole shelf of books.  Then he at two suckers, and walked in and out of the house twice, and was
was all through playing with us.  Ermal took him home, because our house was too quiet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">January 31.</span> Our Stake Relief Society has introduced "A Better Me in '83"
program into each ward.  It seems to be in our stake only.  Marilyn does not have it, neighter does Lolene.
It is a goal setting program, with new goals for every month in the year.  All of the ideas are good, and
some of them, like saying your prayers, and reading the scriptures, quite necessary.  The program is hailed
with joy by most of the sisters, and is doing much good.
</p>

<p>
But I am one of the sisters who must be a trial to my maker.  When I read in those goals, the suggested
scriptures that I go in depth in each month, <em>that I'm even supposed to write about in my journal,</em>
I almost lose my hear from nervous tension.  I simply cannot <em>stand</em> anyone else setting
goals for me.  I feel like I'm tied down, with my mouth pried open, and someone is cramming the whole thing down me.
It takes the spontaneous joy out of the gospel.
</p>

<p>
We're having so much fun reading the Ensign as it appears in our post office box each month,
and in reading the scriptures that go along with our New Testament class in Sunday School. We
love the free and openness of our discussions.
</p>

<p>
We are goal setters.  In thoughtful medidation at the beginning of the year I wrote down
the things that matter most to me, and wrote down the things I want to overcome, and the things
I wanted to accomplish, and I knew that would fill the coming year.
</p>

<p>
When Carol White gave her darling lesson on homemaking last Tuesday, she
touched on our goal setting program.  She's so pretty, I like to watch her
face all the while she talks.  And she makes everyone laugh with her cute wit.
</p>

<p>
<a href="view.html#scan=760" class="scanlink">740</a>
In her lesson, she discussed January's No. 2 goal, "I will select one Long Range Goal that
will help me be a better Homemaker, and I will write it down.  Next, I will list the Short Range
Goals that I need to achieve in order to reach that Long Range Goal.  Then I will take each
Short Range Goal, one at a time, and write down the steps I will take to reach that goal.  By
achieving my Long Range Goal."
</p>

<p>
At the dinner table, I discussed our Relief Society class with Ermal.  I always make him part
of Relief Society.  He almost burst with ridiculous goal setting ideas.  The spirit of the clown
rested heavily upon him, and I scribbled down his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Ok, hon, I want you to give Carol a good report at her next class," he said.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">February 4.</span>  Lolene and Darwin are in Las Vegas tonight, where she is
presenting her original music to the entertainer, Lovelace. And while she was away, Barbara Rasmussen's
music was introduced on Prime Time Access on KSL TV.  Shelly Osterloh introduced Barbara as the lady who
hopes to make Nashville.  Lolene and Debby Walker were the two who presented Barbara's music.  Their
singing was very pretty.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">February 5.</span>  It's a wet, wet world.  The hills are white.  We went to
Zion today to see the snow on the ledges and down in the canyon.  On our way home we stopped to see
Fern and Dew Hirschi.  Fern gave us a sack of Jonathan apples.
</p>

<p>
We saw a blue crane standing in the edge of a pond in Rockville, quite aloof from the ducks and geese.
We walked through the willows and brush along the river's edge, and each time the going became rought,
Ermal reached out his big firm hand taking hold of mine.  I like that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">February 6.</span>  Hilda is all a twitter.  The doctor says she is going to have
a baby.  Hilda told us she would have a blue-eyed, black-haired girl on September 16.  It might even be twins.
</p>

<p>
Ermal and I, and Dave and Doris Libby were set apart today by Bishop Kerry Gubler to the ward missionaries.
Since I get all up tight about these things, Bishop Gubler blessed me that I would relax, and as I relaxed,
my mind would unfold, and I would have great joy in this calling.
</p>

<p>
<span class="entrydate">February 7.</span>  Today has been a people day.  Joy Gubler and Pam Lind came as
my visiting teachers.  THen Shirley and Susanna came.  Shirley is enthused about a tole painting class she is
taking.  She brought a little board decorated with flowers.  Susanna lined all of the dolls up on the couch
and ate crackers.
</p>

<p>
After they left, Venice and Cumon came and we talked of far away places and all sorts of things.  A fire danced
in the fireplace, which usually is a springboard for discussion.  Ermal has this disease that flares up
every time someone says the fireplace is pretty.  Ermal has this disease that flares
up every time someone says fireplace is pretty.  He has this strange malady of planning to plug the fireplace
with an insert.  It would burn less wood.  Then he begins to rationalize.  The insert would cost so many
hundred dollars.  Besides that, he'd rather haul wood than to burn it.  He guesses he'll not get the insert now.
It's easier to turn up the thermostat than to worry about a fire.  He likes hauling wood most of all, but he's not
hepped up about splitting it, and carrying it in, and cleaning out the ashes.  He just wants to cheer up the
house with a fire when it rains or the wind blows.
<a href="view.html#scan=761" class="scanlink">741</a>
So the insert-disease is under control for the moment.  Cumon yawns and guesses they ought to go visit Ruby and Rolly.
</p>

<p>
J. L. and Fern Crawford came next.  They're cousins of mine.  They asked me to prepare a skit for Ermal's 50 year class
reunion in August.  Ideas are brewing in my head.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca and I went for a walk above the canal, and discussed different art projects for school,
then I came home and made cookies.  DeMar and the children came for family night.  Helen had a bad
cold and didn't come.

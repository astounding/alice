  <p class="poemtitle">The Robin</p>
  <p class="poembody">
    Last week I was watching a robin,<br />
    As busy as a bee,<br />
    Gathering grass and flowers,<br />
    Building her nest in a tree.<br />
    Her task was nearly completed,<br />
    When a windstorm came that way<br />
    And destroyed in only a moment<br />
    Her labor of many a day.<br />
    <br />
    But I do admire the robin,<br />
    Though mistfortune she has met,<br />
    She does not droop in sorrow,<br />
    Or brood in vain regret.<br />
    But she is working harder than ever<br />
    In sunshine and in rain,<br />
    And the nest that was ruined a week ago<br />
    Is almost built again.<br />
    <br />
    I think she looks to the future.<br />
    That's why her song is sweet.<br />
    She will not be discouraged,<br />
    Or own she has met defeat.<br />
    She sings as sweetly as ever<br />
    Tho' her loss must have cost her pain,<br />
    And the nest that was ruined a week ago<br />
    Is almost built again.<br />
    <br />
    I wonder if we as humans<br />
    Who brag on how much we know<br />
    Can do as well as the robin<br />
    And sing as we suffer a blow.<br />
    Or don't we much more often<br />
    Just kick and growl and whine<br />
    And make our loss just double<br />
    By wasting precious time?<br />
    <br />
    I hope I have learned my lesson<br />
    From the robin and her nest,<br />
    And that I may meet discouragement<br />
    With new hope in my breast.<br />
    FOr I have come to this conclusion,<br />
    Tho' we may be six feet tall,<br />
    We often haven't as much backbone<br />
    As the robin, after all.

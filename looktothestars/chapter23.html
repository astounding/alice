"Winferd," I called, shaking him out of a deep sleep.  "Wake up.
You'd better get McIntire quick."
</p>

<p>Something had jolted me wide awake, just after midnight on the eleventh
of January.  Winferd jumped out of bed, ran to the kitchen and vigorously
cranked the power company phone.  At the power plant, LaVina Brooks
answered.
</p>

<p>
"Sister Brooks, get the doctor quick.  Our baby is coming."
</p>

<p>
Shivering, I huddled in a blanket on our homemade couch, while Winferd
built a fire.
</p>

<p>
When Dr. McIntire arrived, he asked, "Is the baby to be born on the
couch?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  We're going to move the bed in here," Winferd replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, somebody better move fast."
</p>

<p>
The doctor and Winferd lugged bedding, mattress and our homemade 
wooden bed into the front room by the fire.  By the time the top sheet
was on, our baby had arrived.  Sweat poured down Winferd's pale face, but
he was grinning.
</p>

<p>
"Go get your nurse," McIntire instructed.  "I'll wait until you
get back."
</p>

<p>
So Winferd awoke Mira Lemmon in the night, and stood over her while
she gave the baby an oil bath, and swirled soft curls in her sikly black
hair.  Sister Lemmon wrapped her in a soft pink blanket and laid her in
my arms.  Our darling little daughter!
</p>

<p>
Sitting on the edge of the bed, Winferd gazed tenderly at her.  "You
know," he said, "I've always thought a baby wasn't worth looking at until
it was at least six weeks old.  But our baby doesn't look at all like
a mud fence.  She's beautiful!"
</p>

<p>
Every morning for two weeks, Winferd went in the car after Sister
Lemmon, who bathed the baby and me.  My cousin, Hazel Spendlove, was the
hired girl who did all of the housework.  If I even so much as leaned up
on my elbow, someone would say, "Lie down!  If you don't lie still, you'll
be sorry."
</p>

<p>
<a href="view.html#scan=143" class="scanlink">133</a>
Old ladies frightened me with tales of invalid mothers who either
died early, or suffered a lifetime of misery because of their foolishness
during the critical two weeks after childbirth.  I lay still and
suffered.  On the fifteenth day I was permitted to sit up a little.  My
head spun.  On the sixteenth day I tried to stand.  My feet tingled when
they touched the floor.  When I tried to walk across the room, I staggered.
Hazel left at the end of six weeks, and I almost cried in the dish pan.
</p>

<p>
Marilyn was fed every four hours, and even if she cried her little
eyes out, we didn't futch one minute.  She was never picked up when she
cried.  The Government Bulletin said babies learned to get attention by
crying.  So she was changed, or picked up only when she was good.  She
wasn't neglected.  She never stayed wet a minute.  I washed two dozen
diapers every day.  But the thing Marilyn protested most was being put to
bed after her six o'clock feeding in the evening.  She wanted to play.
The book said to put her down and leave the room, so I did, and she cried
until eight every night.
</p>

<p>
A germ wouldn't have dared get near her.  I wouldn't even take her to
Sacrament meeting to be blessed, for fear someone would breathe on her.
She was blessed at home.
</p>

<p>
The baby kept me so preoccupied that I had no time to think about
leaving the canyon.  But another June was approaching, and with it, the
end of our contract.  The little mud house in LaVerkin was looking more
homey each day, for now it was plumbed, and the kitchen cabinets installed.
</p>

<p>
As we anticipated moving, I realized that life at the springs had
been an adventure.  There had been sweet times, like family gatherings at
baptisms, and funny times, when we were awakened to the laughing and
splashing of swimming parties that came in the night.
</p>

<p>
We had a system for checking up on spontaneous parties.  The light
switch to the pool was just inside our kitchen door.  One of us, usually
Winferd, went to the pool, then the other one flipped the switch, flooding
the building with lights.
</p>

<p>
One night, when the plunging and splashing awoke us, I went ahead,
and Winferd turned on the lights.  Moonlight, streaming through the
doorway, revealed a group playing back-out in and out of the water.  As
the lights came on, four nudes came racing on the wet cement toward me.
Seeing me, three men dove into the water, but the man on lead skidded,
landing on his back, with his feet almost touching mine.
</p>

<p>
Bewildered, he grinned and said, "Hello."
</p>

<p>
Winferd had arrived by that time, and I retreated.
</p>

<p>
"We didn't want to disturb you," one of the men said.  "We left the
money for our swims on the little shelf by your office door."
</p>

<p>
And they had.  They were business men from Cedar, returning home
from a convention in Las Vegas.
</p>

<p>
The next time squealing and splashing awoke us, Winferd went first,
and I turned on the lights.  Pink bodies, screaching and running, disappeared
out the back door.  Clothes hung on pegs in the dressing rooms,
but no one returned for them until the afternoon of the following day.
</p>

<p>

Chagrined boys and girls had climbed barefoot and naked, up to the canal,
through boulders and brush, and waded home.  Some of them lived on the
opposite side of Hurricane.
</p>

<p>
On Easter weekends, there were more people in the pool than water.
This was the busiest time of the year&mdash;the one time when the money rolled
in.  Pleasant memories lingered as I recalled the Sunday School classes,
Scout Troops, and family gatherings at the pool.  I thought of Will and
Maria Simpkins, the people we lived with the first year I went to college.
</p>

<p>
Sister Simkins came to bathe for her arthritis.  Will also needed to
soak his black and blue face.  When asked what happened to him, Will
replied, "Maria hit me."
</p>

<p>
"Honest Will, did she do that?" someone asked.
</p>

<p>
Sister Simkins' hands were so crippled with arthritis she couldn't
have hit anyone.  What really happened was that when Will started to
hobble his milk cow, she kicked him before he was through, and the loose
hobble struck his face.
</p>

<p>
Their granddaughter Glennis stayed at the springs for two weeks with
them.  Every afternoon, she and I went in the pool, where I tried to each
her to swim.  She was such a skinny little kid that she never even learned
to float, but trying to teach her was fun.
</p>

<p>
For the past two years I had been swimming daily, except for the time
when Marilyn came.  Now I wondered&mdash;was I hooked on swimming?  Could I
stand not to swim?  Each time I went to town to look at our little house,
and to breathe the smell of fresh plaster and new pine lumber, I had no
question where my heart was.
</p>

<p>
Johnny Larson took over the springs on the first day of June and we
moved into our home.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the stove, refrigerator and radio, the furniture in our
home was made by Winferd.  The couch was made from old barn boards and
car spring seats, firmly padded, and covered with an Indian blanket.  He
made the Early American cabinet for our books and radio, and he made
the table and our bed.  Kate painted a wood scene with squirrels and a
little boy, on unbleached muslin curtains, that served as a closet door
beneath the high fruit shelves.  Our new little home was as cleverly and
compactly arranged as a sheep wagon, and we loved it.
</p>

<p>
President Roosevelt had some kind of surplus buying program going,
and the government bought our little range cow that Grandpa Gubler had
given us, for $14.00.  With the money, we bought a crib for Marilyn&mdash;our
first real purchase since moving to LaVerkin.
</p>

<p>
My first ward job was to teach Trail Builder boys in Primary.  I
taught the Blazers, Helen Glendenning the Trekkers, and Aunt Harriet Woodbury
the Guides.  We planned all of our activites together&mdash;kite tournaments,
cook-outs, and home coming programs.  Day after day, our boys
molded clay animals and little farmers from the smooth, sub-soil from
our basement.  When the little models were cured and dried, they painted
them with poster paints and shellacked them.  Aunt Harriet designed a
farm yard, buildings and all, making tile roofs from corrugated pasteboard.
The Home Coming display was cute and clever.  Aunt Hattie and
Helen were two of the most tireless and devoted Gospel Teachers that have
ever touched my life.

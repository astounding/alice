      Papa counseled us more often than Mama did, simply because he was

 usually there, especially in the mornings and evenings, and Mama was

 always busy.  Since Sam Pollock had repeatedly warned about the devil pay-

 ing our parents off in sons-in-laws. Papa did his part to see that the

 devil had nothing to do with it.  He didn't take my dating with Orval Judd

 seriously, because Orval was Maurice's brother, and more like a relative.

 But when other dates came on the scene, I was lectured about the dangers

 of going with strangers.

      I tolerated the lectures  and Papa's anxious counseling, realizing

 I was also included in his prayers.  It was Papa who always called to us

 from his bed upstairs  when we came in at nights.  No matter how late we

 were, he never slept until we were safely home.

      One of my girl friends worked at the Bradshaw Hotel, and on Sunday

 evenings, when she was off-duty, our gang collected there.  At the Hotel,

 we naturally met strangers.

      One evening, three of the hotel guests invited three of us to go for

 a little spin.  I had a queer feeling as I got in the front seat of the car

 with the driver.  The other two couples took the back seat.  Because I

 didn't want to be a "wet blanket" I ignored the prompting to not go. I

 knew Papa would never approve of the stranger at my side.

      For awhile, we cruised about town.  Pilled with apprehension, I sat

 speechless, and the other girls seemed tongue-tied too.  The driver slowly

 turned down "lover's lane",  a road leading into a thick grove of fig trees,

 and parked.  I was scared.

      When he slid toward me, I quickly opened the car door and said, "Shall

 we walk?"

      He was agreeable, and we strolled out from the dark cover of the trees

 and down the lane.  Oh,how I wanted the Lord's protection, but I felt em-

 barrassed to ask him.  But in the starlight, opportunity for escape loomed

 before me.  It was the gate to my cousins   Burr and Evadna Bradshaw's

 place.

      '"//ell,  it has been nice knowing you," I said, "and now I'll say good-

 night.  Thanks for walking me home."

       Flabbergasted, he said, "This isn't your house is it?"

                                  -88-

      "Sure," I fibbed.

      "Well, I'll be - - .  Say, you can't go in now.  We just got together."

      "Sorry, but I've got to go in.  The folks will wonder what happened to
me."

      "Goodnight then."  He reached for me, but I sped up the walk.

     The house was dark, but I knew I had to go in, so I opened the door
and stepped inside.  Peering through the screen, I watched as he reluctantly
started back up the lane.  I was afraid my pounding heart and shaking frame
would wake Burr and Evadna.

     Would that man ever get far enough away so I could slip back outside?
At last, I could see him no more.  Flattening myself against the wall, I
slid out the screen door and along the porch to the rear of the house.  I
banged into an old wash tub in the back yard, which almost gave me a heart
attack.  Crouching, I listened, but could hear no one coming.  I knew I
had to make time, because when the man got back to the car, he would learn
that I had pulled a fast one on him, and the others would come looking for
me.

     Running through the trees, I scratched myself on the branches.  When I
came to the big ditch, half the canal, it seemed, was tumbling through its
rocky banks.  I would be seen if I crossed the foot bridge, so I stepped
gingerly from rock to rock.  The beam of a spot light bobbed up and down
through the orchard.  Slipping, I stumbled.  Drenched to my knees, I
crouched behind a clump of poplar saplings on the bank, just as the car
turned its beam on the spot where I had been.  I huddled, panting, as the
spot light lingered on the saplings, but the thick clump concealed me, and
they went on by.

     On reaching the street, I ran like a deer.  Now the car was coming
back toward me.  Winded and beat, I dropped to the ground and rolled under
a barbed wire fence into the grass.  The spot light criss-crossed the road,
playing along the fence and lingering on every bush.  Secure in the grass,
I could get my breath.  Back and forth they went, searching the grass where
I lay.  Knowing I couldn't be far away, they persisted.  A bent, dry grass-
head gouged my ear, but I didn't dare move.  Insects crawled on me, still.,
I lay motionless.  At last, the car turned the corner and took off in an-
other direction.  They must have supposed I had taken another way home.

     I crawled from under the fence, and my feet flew.  I just got to Ether
Wood's corner when I saw them coming again.  Our house was kitty-corner
through the block, so I darted through Wood's gate, around their house and
through the trees.  The spot light played up and down the sidewalk.

     I cut through Uncle Marion Stout's corral.  The horses snorted and
a big red bull came toward me.  Caught between a maize of fences and that
rumbling bull was more frightening even  than the spot light.  Terrified, I
scrambled through, and at last was on home soil.  Panting, I sped up the
pathway from the barn, and through the kitchen door.

     From upstairs. Papa called,"Is that you Alice?"

     "Yes," I answered gratefully.

     "This is more like it," he said."I'm glad you're getting home early."

                                  -89-

      The spot light played on the front of the house, and I knew in that

 moment how Peter Rabbit felt  when he stumbled gratefully into the rabbit

 hole after the farmer had chased him.

      This episode livened up the party for the others, for the "fox chase"

 definitely beat parking.  My friends realized the folly of our going for

 a spin in the first place.

      Annie and Rass ran the Flatnose Ranch in Nevada for Uncle John

 Hopkins.  Kate and I took the train from Cedar to Lund, where Rass met us

 This was my first train ride.  Rass, Annie,and little baby Keith, dressed*

 in his bib overalls and big straw hat, took us in their rattling pickup

 sight seeing.  Kate and I sat in the back and sang, and raised sun blisters

 on our noses as we jounced along.  We visited igloo.shaped lime kilns,

 mining towns, ranchers and Mexicans.

      Back at the ranch  was an out-door shower made of a barrel  mounted

 on a platform.  We carried water from the creek, and climbing the ladder

 poured it into the barrel.  Standing beneath it in our bathing suits, we'

 turned on the shower.  We had to soap and scrub fast to get clean before

 the water was all gone.

     At the head of the alfalfa field  was a reservoir of warm water. Kate

 was a good swimmer, but that dark, mossy water scared me.  As I walked

 gingerly into the edge of it, fluffy mud swirled about my feet and the icky

 stuff oozed between my toes.  I felt like the water was inhabitated by

 SS   ^ ' ^"^-^led creatures tangled in the long strings of water

 ^ M i r^   slt on the bank and watch the overhanging branches of

 the black willow  dip and dimple the water.

     With notebook and pencil, I leaned against the tree and scribbled my

 random thoughts.  Mama had requested that I keep a diary during my seven^

 teenth year -and that year was almost over.  She said to keep it for a

 birthday gift to my oldest daughter when she turned seventeen. »

  am sorry I did.             y    ^timental feelings, I burned it.  Now I

                                 -90-
woodpile.  I tried to make myself small and inconspicuous.  Picking up chips
was humiliating to me.  If I had it to do over, I think I would skip and
sing as I toted the black coal scuttle after kindlings.  I took no joy in
pushing the heavy broom over the splintering, oiled wood floor, nor in
dusting the shelves and tables with the waxy  rags that should have been
burned.  Attitude makes the difference between Heaven and Hell.  My attitude
made this job Hades, especially on the dreadful December day when Hurricane
shivered in a sixty-mile gale.

     I struck half a box of matches that morning, trying to get the fire
started.  I had only slick magazine pages and damp chips.  My teeth chat-
tered and my fingers were numb by the time the fire took hold.  The room
was bitter cold, so as the fire flamed up, I fed it more and more wood and
coal, until the pot-bellied stove glowed red.

     Then  the twenty-foot stove-pipe collapsed across the sewing tables
and over the book shelves.  The stove was located on the opposite side of
the room from the flue, so more heat would be given off by the long, black
pipe wired to the ceiling.  Generations of soot, which had collected in
the pipe, billowed into the room, blinding and suffocating me.  Flames and
smoke shot up from the roaring, red hot stove.  Anthony, who was working in
the next room, came running.  I was both angry and terrified.  Through the
choking, black confusion, he remained calm.  Summoning help from the
street, he put out the fire, then cleaned up the pipes, anchoring them
back in place.  We had no vacuum, and the feathery soot swirled like a
flurry of mischievous spirits in front of my broom.  For days, whisps of
soot puffed out to plague me  from between the books on the library shelves,
until I had been able to deep clean every crevice. Sewing classes were sus-
pended for one day.

     Our sewing teacher, deone Smith, dispelled the gloom of winter in
the sewing room, by ushering in Spring in December.  She had her students
start on their spring dresses.  The room became cheerful with voiles,
chiffons and georgette in rainbow colors,  deone was the beautiful daugh-
ter of the Church Patriarch, Hyrum Smith.  We were honored to have her as
a teacher, and even more honored when she married Alma Isom from Hurricane.

     Stella Willis, the world's champion typist, presented a lyceum assem-
bly at Hurricane.  She could carry on a normal conversation,and type one-
hundred and twenty-five words a minute  accurately, at the same time.  I
was dumfounded when she called me to the stage to give me a concentration
test.  Dazed, I sat down to the spanking new Underwood, with my copy
material before me.  At the signal to start, the typewriter purred.  It was
a good machine.  As the questions were fired at me, I managed to briefly
say "sure",  "yes",  "no",  "of course", and "I don't know".  Mss Willis
checked my finished sheet and announced that I had accurately typed ninety
words a minute.  The assembly applauded.  I was glad to get off the staoe
and melt in with the crowd.  I felt certain Miss Willis had exaggerated"mv
ability.

     Our first year type teacher, Laura Lund, had married the elementary
music teacher, Elvis Bird Terry.  June Bunker was the second year teacher.
She took a group of us to Cedar to the High School Days at the BAC   There
I won a typing scholarship.  At the same time, Mrs. Ruesch, our English

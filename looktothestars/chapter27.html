In the wintertime, we cooked on the little camp stove that heated the
house. One day, Norman bathed his rubber doll and put it on a cookie sheet
in the oven to dry. Not knowing it was there, I built a fire and baked it.
When the air turned blue with rubber smoke, I yanked open the oven door.
There, looking like a gingerbread man, lay the doll, melted flat and bubbly.
Norman cried brokenheartedly.
</p>

<p>
"You can play with my old doll," Marilyn consoled, "but don't cook it."
</p>

<p>
Whenever our watering turn came, the ditch became an irresistable lure
to Norman. Deliberately he lost his balance whenever he got near it.
Constantly I paddled him and changed his duds, but the magnetism of that ditch
drew him to it, where he helplessly (?) tumbled in. Then capering into the
house, trailing mud, he'd look at me in wide-eyed innocence and say, "Spank
Norman. He fall in ditch."
</p>

<p>
One day, I changed his clothes three times. He was getting down to
rock bottom. Mariliyn said, "Little brother can borrow my clothes. He likes
to be a girl."
</p>

<p>
And he did. He grinned proudly as he wore her dress, and managed to
stay out of the ditch for the rest of the day.
</p>

<p>
Thum sucking was Norman's big obsession. By tying his hands in
gloves bulky as boxing gloves, I managed to keep his thumb out of his
mouth at nights, but he made up for it during the day. Whenever he touched
a bit of fur, wool, or cotton, up went his thumb. Anything fuzzy was
appealing. If he couldn't enjoy his thumb peacefully in the house, which
he never could while I was around, he'd go outside. We had pitched a tent
on the lawn in our sunken garden, and Norman would stand in the tent door,
hanging on to the frayed edge of the marquisette screen with one hand, and
enjoying his thumb with the other. Or he'd crawl through the fence to the
<a href="view.html#scan=154" class="scanlink">144</a>
north of the house and get hold of an old deer hide Winferd had stretched
out on the wall. Or he would go out on the square and sit down in a
meadow of fuzzy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtail_%28diaspore%29">foxtails</a>. Every friendly pup that let him hang onto its
neck, or cat that brushed him with its tail, inspired his thumb sucking.
One day I found him by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullein">mullein</a> clump, rubbing the soft nap of the
fuzzy leaves with one hand and joyfully sucking his thumb. Fearful that
I would never break him from the habit, I hoped his wife would carry on
from where I left off. He could be such a bad example to his children,
going around with his thumb in his mouth. It would be like having only
one hand. Of course, his wife could announce, "Supper's on." Meal
times he loved, and his thumb got a chance to dry off. Often he'd watch
as I set the table, and would ask, "Doing Alice, Mudder?"
</p>

<p>
One night Winferd and I went to a Sunday School Board meeting at
Hurricane. Since we couldn't get a baby sitter, we consoled ourselves
with the thought that since we were on the Lord's errand, the children
would be looked after. (I don't recommend this philosophy to my
posterity.) It was a hot July night, and our beds were outside in the
tent. We wanted the children to sleep in the house while we were gone,
but Norman begged so hard that we lefet him alone in the tent.
</p>

<p>
Hurrying home from the meeting, I went to check on Norman, while
Winferd went to the house to check on Marilyn. Norman was not in the
tent. A queer little tremor went through me, but I supposed he must have
gon in the house.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Norman?" I called as Winferd came to the door.
</p>

<p>
"No, he isn't in here," he replied.
</p>

<p>
I felt again in his bed, and in Marilyn's and in ours.  I looked under
the beds.  There was positively no Norman.  Together we searched through
the house, the clothes basket, the shower, in the closet and under
everything.  Still no Norman.  Frantically I ran to Vernon Church's, while
Winferd called and searched about the lot.  Still we could find no trace
of Norman.  I took the flashlight and Winferd went in the car across the
square.  I stopped at every tree, looking through the clumps of saplings,
and as just going to the church house, when Winferd called, "Here he is."
</p>

<p>
Breathing a prayer of thanksgiving, I ran to where they were.  Winferd
had found Norman between the screen door and the wooden door to Graff's
store, just sitting, looking out and waiting.
</p>

<p>
"Norman, what are you doing here?" Winferd asked.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to go wif you," was his reply.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Masculine ego begins early.  While Norman was so little, he often
felt so big.  He'd put on his hat and say, "I gotta go to work," and strut
out the door, his short legs making time.  Everything he did was big and
important, just like his dad.
</p>

<p>
When I'd ask Winferd about some little thing, he'd offer answer, "I
didn't notice.  I had more weighty matters on my mind."
</p>

<p>
What a pair!  Always thinking big things.
</p>

<p>
Norman would often march to the door and say, "Goodbye, Alice.  I'm
going to California."
</p>

<p>
<a href="view.html#scan=155" class="scanlink">145</a>
I would kiss him goodbye, and two minutes later I could hear him
imitating the motor of a car as he buzzed around in his sandpile.  He built
bridges, roads, tunnels and dams, if only I had the imagination to recognize
them.  But he didn't keep his construction in the sandpile.  Every
meal he buzzed around his plate with a crust of bread for a car and built
bridges with his spoon.  Marilyn often followed suit.  Occasionally their
cars went down a tunnel and were swallowed.  We could only take so much,
especially when they started having waterfalls from their spoons with
their juicy food.
</p>

<p>
Marilyn and Norman usually cooperated in their ventures.  Even when
I tied them up for running away, they enjoyed themselves by making a game
of it.
</p>

<p>
Marilyn often had weighty matters on her mind, too.  One day she
asked, "Mother, will you take care of me when I have my baby?  And can
my husband and I live in your house while he builds a new house for us?"
She shared this same concern about Norman's wife too.
</p>

<p>
One day she solemnly stated, "If Daddy had known you was going to
spank your kids, he wouldn't of let you be his wife."
</p>

<p>
Another time, she breathlessly reported, "Mother, there's some horses
out in Daddy's Mother's Husband's field."
</p>

<p>
As I stooped to kiss Norman goodnight, at the close of a day when he
had been dreamily singing himself to sleep, he said, "Mother, my song says
the buttercups say the bright moon is in the tree tops and the birds says
it's the bright sun."

While attending school at the <a href="../places/bac.html">B.A.C.</a>, Alice for a while dated a gentleman
she referred to as "BAC" in her book.

Alice would sometimes use nicknames or made-up names in place of the actual names of those involved in various
experiences she wrote about so as to protect the identities of those she wrote about out of concern that the
subject of her writing might not wish to be mentioned publically in her book.

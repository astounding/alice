<a href="scans.html?p=146" class="scanlink">136</a>
In the dark morning hours on the 29th of February, we were up and
bustling.  This time, the bed was already set up in our front room.
</p>

<p>
"Doc, can't we wait until tomorrow to have this baby?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott, why?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because it's Leap-Year Day.  The poor little kid will only get a
birthday once every four years."
</p>

<p>
"That's too bad, but this baby isn't going to wait," he answered.
</p>

<p>
So scrawny little Murry Norman came, all six pounds of him.  After
the doctor and the nurse had gone, Winferd kissed me and said, "Now we
have a son."
</p>

<p>
"Look, he isn't breathing," I cried.
</p>

<p>
Norman's face had turned purple.  Winferd grabbed the limp little
<a href="scans.html?p=147" class="scanlink">137</a>
fellow, shaking him until he began to breathe.  White-faced, Winferd sat
holding his little son.  Again the baby's face turned dark, and Winferd
worked frantically to get him breathing once more.  Goodness!  Didn't our
little boy want to stay with us?
</p>

<p>
LaPriel was our hired girl.  One thing the Government Bulletin had
left out was the fact that a child should learn to feed himself.  I had
never let Marilyn hold her own spoon because she would make a mess.  And
now, I lay in our combined bedroom, kitchen, dining room, etc., and watched
in distress as LaPriel put Marilyn in her high chair and handed her a dish
of food and a spoon.  I wanted to cry out, "Feed her," but suddenly I was
ashamed of my own default&mdash;ashamed to admit that although Marilyn was
more than two years old, she didn't know what to do with a spoon.  LaPriel
seemed unaware that she scraped all of Marilyn's frood out for the first
few meals.  But that was all.  Instinct took over.  LIke a little pig,
Marilyn finally dug in.
</p>

<p>
Winferd killed a chicken before he went to work one morning, leaving
it for LaPriel to clean.  The chickens were Marilyn's playmates that she
shared her cracker crumbs with.  Her eyes grew big at the sight of the
liveless one, and when LaPriel started to scaled it over a tub, Marilyn
screamed, "Don't.  No, no, don't hurt chickie!"
</p>

<p>
A look of horror came over LaPriel's face.  "Alice, I can't stand it."
</p>

<p>
"Come here, Marilyn," I coaxed.
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly she came.  LaPriel finished scalding the chicken, and
started to pluck it.
</p>

<p>
Breaking away from me, Marilyn screamed, "No, no.  Don't take off
chickie's clothes."
</p>

<p>
LaPriel almost wept as she finished the task, and Marilyn sobbed
broken-heartedly.
</p>

<p>
Grandma Gubler was the nurse that came daily for two weeks, bringing
with her special treats.
</p>

<p>
Marilyn took over the baby in every possible way.  One morning, when
he lay on a blanket on the table ready for his bath, she climbed up on a
chair to watch.  "Nice baby," she cooed, kissing him on his bare tummy.
"Nice baby brudder," kiss, kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Wah, wah, wah," Norman howled.
</p>

<p>
Whirling from the sink, I grabbed Marilyn, scooting her down.  Tell-tale
teeth marks showed red on Norman's soft, pink tummy.  Marilyn had
loved too deeply.
</p>

<p>
Another time, when Norman fussed in his basket, Marilyn said, "Brudder
wants dinner."  And then a choking sound came from the basket.  I ran.
She had dropped half of a shelled walnut into his mouth.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
The excavation in your yard yawned wide, waiting to become a basement.
The wind, the sun and the rain took over.  Sucker shoots from the Lombardy
poplars along the fence sprouted in the clay walls, and were fast becoming
long, leafy saplings.  Wind borne seeds came to rest in the subsoil,
and weeds grew.  In the center of the hole, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> grew, a beautiful
lacy thing, waving pink plumes.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=148" class="scanlink">138</a>
"Wow isn't that nice," I exclaimed.  "We have a flower garden already."
</p>

<p>
Winferd's brow crinkled.  "But I didn't plan this for a sunken garden."
</p>

<p>
"Sunken garden!"  My mind leaped at the words.  "Why not?  Winferd, we
could have fun and really enjoy our basement until we get money enough to
build."
</p>

<p>
With a pained look he said, "That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> is growing in the hall
outside the bathroom."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  We won't be moving in for a few days."
</p>

<p>
I stood transfixed as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> danced in the breeze.  "Boy, oh
boy, I can see it all now.  Come here!"
</p>

<p>
Grabbing his hand, I led him into the house.  We sat tat the table while
I sketched a design for a formal garden.
</p>

<p>
"Might as well," he conceded.
</p>

<p>
With tape, hemp string and pegs, we laid out the design on our "basement
floor".  He wheelbarrowed a thin layer of barnyard litter and sand
on the little plots.
</p>

<p>
"Now it's up to you," he said.  "Have fun."
</p>

<p>
With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> as the focal point, we began with a diamond-shaped
patch of lawn.  Next came an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssum">alyssium</a> border, then a cinder pathwalk.
Bordering the outside of the path were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropaeolum">nasturtiums</a>, followed by purple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petunia">petunias</a>.  In each corner of the basement was a triangle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinnia">zinnias</a>.  The
garden grew as pretty as planned.  Standing on the bank looking down at
the flamboyant flower faces was satisfaction.  If we'd had money to build,
we'd never have known the fun of a sunken garden.  Poverty is sometimes
elegant.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
When Marilyn begged to sleep on the camp cot outside, Winferd said,
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
Shocked, I said, "A little two-and-one-half year old kid sleeping outside alone?"
</p>

<p>
"What difference does being little make?"
</p>

<p>
"She'll get scared in the night."
</p>

<p>
"There's not a thing out there to hurt her."
</p>

<p>
So Marilyn slept alone under the pecan tree.  She loved outdoors and
everything that lived there.
</p>

<p>
And the chickens loved her.  The wire hook that fastened the pen gate
was within her reach, and she couldn't resist the fun of the feathered excitement
as the flock squawked past her into the garden.  The paddling she
got seemed worth the pleasure of doing it again and again.  And then egg
production dropped, in spite of the daily cackling chorus.  One afternoon
I heard Marilyn giggling above the clucking of the chickens.  I found her
sitting on the ground in front of the woodpile, the entire flock of fat
hens gathering around her.  On her lap was a pan of eggs.  One by one she
was breaking them onto a shingle, where the greedy chickens guzzled them.
</p>

<p>
"Stop it, Marilyn" I shouted.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=149" class="scanlink">139</a>
"But the chickies <em>like</em> eggs," she replied.
</p>

<p>
Shooing the flock away, I grabbed the pan from her and turned her over
and paddled.  but always, the fluttering, cackling and clucking of the
chickens pressing against the mesh wire at sight of her was too much.  She
slipped into the run to drop an occasional egg for them to devour.  The wire
hook on the gate had to be replaced with a strap buckled through the fence.
</p>

<p>
The milk cow received the same loving attention from her that the
chickens did.  Often, when the cow was lying down, Marilyn crawled through
the corral fence and climbed onto her back, laying her face against the
cow's hairy hide.  Oblivious to her, the cow continued to chew her cud.
</p>

<p>
Grandma Gubler had a skitterish nag that jumped whenever a car went
down the street.  When she was fastened to the plow, she often jumped sidewise,
almost tangling Winferd in the reins.  She was dangerous.
</p>

<p>
One morning when Marilyn had disappeared, I spied her in the field
next to the house, her arms lovingly wrapped around the nervous nag's hind
leg, her face pressed against its flank.  winferd caught sight of her, too.
As he reached my side, he put a finger to his lips, indicating that we must
not make a sound.  Silently we watched and prayed.  Marilyn loved and patted
the horse to her heart's content, and it never flinched a muscle until
after she walked away and crawled through the fence to safety.
</p>

<p>
But the animals weren't always so considerate.  One Sunday morning
when I had dressed Marilyn in a new yellow dress and bonnet, she felt so
grand that she walked to where the cow was staked in the grass.  Spreading
out her skirt, she said, "Hi cow.  See pretty dress!"
</p>

<p>
The cow lowered its head, and with a snort and a bunt, landed Marilyn
in a steaming fresh pile of manure.  She cried like her heart would break.
To try to describe my feelings would be futile!
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
In June, the County Agent, Anson call, took a bus load of beet seed
growers on a tour through Arizona and Southern California, to study methods
of harvesting and raising beets.  The Beet Seed Industry had been growing in
Washington County since 1932.  Since Winferd cultivated and tended Grandpa
Gubler's beet seed crop, he was asked to take the tour.  It was an opportunity
for a real vacation for him.  He enjoyed the change of pace, and the
chance to be with "the boys".
</p>

<p>
A smorgasbord was spread before them at each stop.  Once, when Roland
Webb noticed a bowl of what looked like mashed turniips, he exclaimed, "Oh
boy, I love buttered turnips," and proceeded to heap his plate.  When tears
streamed down his face over the first spoon full, someone exclaimed,
"Horseradish," and everyone laughed.
</p>

<p>
In September, Winferd went to Salt Lake as a delegate to the Republican
Convention.  While there he enjoyed a reunion with some of his missionary
companions, Allen Wood, Del Fairbourne, and Royden Mccullough, and attended a
Grocer's Convention, where they forecasted a future day when shoppers could
actually buy pre-cooked food.  Also they forecasted a time when dish washing
would be done away with.  He ate off a plate that was consumed with his
food.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=150" class="scanlink">140</a>
We attended a pageant at the St. George Temple, a dramatizeation of the
progress of Utah's Dixie.  Two thousand spectators viewed it from the
southeast lawn.  One of the most thrilling moments was when Dilworth Snow was
spotlighted near the top of the temple, singing, "This is the Place, Dear
Utah".  Earl Bleak accompanied him on the trumpet.  Mary McGregor, a feast
for the eyes in her Indian costume, sang in a clear, beautiful voice,
"Indian Love Call".
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
When the chill of the nights and the gold of October days reddened and
ripened the heavy bunches of cane seed, and turned the blades on the stocks
to rattling, rasping swords, then came Molasses Making time in LaVerkin.
An unwritten law, which every Molasses Maker's wife understood, was the
singleness of purpose in their household&mdash;Molasses Making.  The cane was
cut and topped, then hauled on horse-drawn sleds to the mill, where the
green, frothy juice was squeezed out between heavy steel rollers.  usually
there was one man on the boiler and two on the sleds.  The wives of the
Molasses Makers waited on their men until the session was over.
</p>

<p>
When I came into the Gubler Clan, I married a Molasses Maker.  Most of
the time, Grandpa "boiled" and winferd and his brothers "hauled and squeezed".
Horses hitched to a sweep marched in a circle all day long, turning the mill.
Grandma or the girls toted the men's dinners to them in large pails, because
neither the boiler nor the mill could be interrupted.  The men ate on
the job.  Even though the cane grew just across the street from the house,
dinner was still carried to the field.  As the boys married, their wives continued
to tote their pails, perpetuating the old custom.  Usually, making
molasses was a race against oncoming frost.  The race lasted from three to
six weeks and everyone put in double time.
</p>

<p>
The dinners were not lunches, but full-course meals of hot, mashed
potatoes, gravy, meat, salads, and pies, the same as would have been served
at the table, using just as many dishes.  This required a huge milk bucket
for each man.  The bucket was cumbersome and heavy to lug.
</p>

<p>
So now we found ourselves living just over the fence from the cane
field.  Dutifully, I neglected my house and babies to prepare the big
bucket of hot dishes for my man.  Anxiety trailed me across the field, because
i never knew what the "old baby" might do to the "new baby" while I
lugged my hot and awkward load across the rough furrows and stubble of the
cane field.  Often I met Winferd in the field and he sat on the sled and
ate, while I waited to carry back the dishes.
</p>

<p>
Rebellion arose within me.  "Why should I knock myself out dragging
this weary load into the field," I asked myself, "when he drives right by
the house?  After all, it is easier for him to come into the house and
carry his food out in his stomach, than it is for me to fuss and arrange
all of those cumbersome bowls."
</p>

<p>
"Look dear," I said, "from now on, you just hop over that fence and
come and sit down to the table.  All the world knows a man has to take time
out to eat.  You're not more than one block away from your own table any of
the time during Molasses Making.  If it isn't worth your time to come in
and eat, it isn't worth my time to take the food to you."
</p>

<p>
That was it.  Winferd came home to eat.  The idea caught on.  Others
took a turn at the boiler, and even Grandpa learned to go home to dinner.

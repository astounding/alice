<a href="scans.html?p=146" class="scanlink">136</a>
In the dark morning hours on the 29th of February, we were up and
bustling.  This time, the bed was already set up in our front room.
</p>

<p>
"Doc, can't we wait until tomorrow to have this baby?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott, why?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because it's Leap-Year Day.  The poor little kid will only get a
birthday once every four years."
</p>

<p>
"That's too bad, but this baby isn't going to wait," he answered.
</p>

<p>
So scrawny little Murry Norman came, all six pounds of him.  After
the doctor and the nurse had gone, Winferd kissed me and said, "Now we
have a son."
</p>

<p>
"Look, he isn't breathing," I cried.
</p>

<p>
Norman's face had turned purple.  Winferd grabbed the limp little
<a href="scans.html?p=147" class="scanlink">137</a>
fellow, shaking him until he began to breathe.  White-faced, Winferd sat
holding his little son.  Again the baby's face turned dark, and Winferd
worked frantically to get him breathing once more.  Goodness!  Didn't our
little boy want to stay with us?
</p>

<p>
LaPriel was our hired girl.  One thing the Government Bulletin had
left out was the fact that a child should learn to feed himself.  I had
never let Marilyn hold her own spoon because she would make a mess.  And
now, I lay in our combined bedroom, kitchen, dining room, etc., and watched
in distress as LaPriel put Marilyn in her high chair and handed her a dish
of food and a spoon.  I wanted to cry out, "Feed her," but suddenly I was
ashamed of my own default&mdash;ashamed to admit that although Marilyn was
more than two years old, she didn't know what to do with a spoon.  LaPriel
seemed unaware that she scraped all of Marilyn's frood out for the first
few meals.  But that was all.  Instinct took over.  LIke a little pig,
Marilyn finally dug in.
</p>

<p>
Winferd killed a chicken before he went to work one morning, leaving
it for LaPriel to clean.  The chickens were Marilyn's playmates that she
shared her cracker crumbs with.  Her eyes grew big at the sight of the
liveless one, and when LaPriel started to scaled it over a tub, Marilyn
screamed, "Don't.  No, no, don't hurt chickie!"
</p>

<p>
A look of horror came over LaPriel's face.  "Alice, I can't stand it."
</p>

<p>
"Come here, Marilyn," I coaxed.
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly she came.  LaPriel finished scalding the chicken, and
started to pluck it.
</p>

<p>
Breaking away from me, Marilyn screamed, "No, no.  Don't take off
chickie's clothes."
</p>

<p>
LaPriel almost wept as she finished the task, and Marilyn sobbed
broken-heartedly.
</p>

<p>
Grandma Gubler was the nurse that came daily for two weeks, bringing
with her special treats.
</p>

<p>
Marilyn took over the baby in every possible way.  One morning, when
he lay on a blanket on the table ready for his bath, she climbed up on a
chair to watch.  "Nice baby," she cooed, kissing him on his bare tummy.
"Nice baby brudder," kiss, kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Wah, wah, wah," Norman howled.
</p>

<p>
Whirling from the sink, I grabbed Marilyn, scooting her down.  Tell-tale
teeth marks showed red on Norman's soft, pink tummy.  Marilyn had
loved too deeply.
</p>

<p>
Another time, when Norman fussed in his basket, Marilyn said, "Brudder
wants dinner."  And then a choking sound came from the basket.  I ran.
She had dropped half of a shelled walnut into his mouth.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
The excavation in your yard yawned wide, waiting to become a basement.
The wind, the sun and the rain took over.  Sucker shoots from the Lombardy
poplars along the fence sprouted in the clay walls, and were fast becoming
long, leafy saplings.  Wind borne seeds came to rest in the subsoil,
and weeds grew.  In the center of the hole, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> grew, a beautiful
lacy thing, waving pink plumes.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=148" class="scanlink">138</a>
"Wow isn't that nice," I exclaimed.  "We have a flower garden already."
</p>

<p>
Winferd's brow crinkled.  "But I didn't plan this for a sunken garden."
</p>

<p>
"Sunken garden!"  My mind leaped at the words.  "Why not?  Winferd, we
could have fun and really enjoy our basement until we get money enough to
build."
</p>

<p>
With a pained look he said, "That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> is growing in the hall
outside the bathroom."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right.  We won't be moving in for a few days."
</p>

<p>
I stood transfixed as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> danced in the breeze.  "Boy, oh
boy, I can see it all now.  Come here!"
</p>

<p>
Grabbing his hand, I led him into the house.  We sat tat the table while
I sketched a design for a formal garden.
</p>

<p>
"Might as well," he conceded.
</p>

<p>
With tape, hemp string and pegs, we laid out the design on our "basement
floor".  He wheelbarrowed a thin layer of barnyard litter and sand
on the little plots.
</p>

<p>
"Now it's up to you," he said.  "Have fun."
</p>

<p>
With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarix">tamarack</a> as the focal point, we began with a diamond-shaped
patch of lawn.  Next came an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssum">alyssium</a> border, then a cinder pathwalk.
Bordering the outside of the path were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropaeolum">nasturtiums</a>, followed by purple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petunia">petunias</a>.  In each corner of the basement was a triangle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinnia">zinnias</a>.  The
garden grew as pretty as planned.  Standing on the bank looking down at
the flamboyant flower faces was satisfaction.  If we'd had money to build,
we'd never have known the fun of a sunken garden.  Poverty is sometimes
elegant.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
When Marilyn begged to sleep on the camp cot outside, Winferd said,
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
Shocked, I said, "A little two-and-one-half year old kid sleeping outside alone?"
</p>

<p>
"What difference does being little make?"
</p>

<p>
"She'll get scared in the night."
</p>

<p>
"There's not a thing out there to hurt her."
</p>

<p>
So Marilyn slept alone under the pecan tree.  She loved outdoors and
everything that lived there.
</p>

<p>
And the chickens loved her.  The wire hook that fastened the pen gate
was within her reach, and she couldn't resist the fun of the feathered excitement
as the flock squawked past her into the garden.  The paddling she
got seemed worth the pleasure of doing it again and again.  And then egg
production dropped, in spite of the daily cackling chorus.  One afternoon
I heard Marilyn giggling above the clucking of the chickens.  I found her
sitting on the ground in front of the woodpile, the entire flock of fat
hens gathering around her.  On her lap was a pan of eggs.  One by one she
was breaking them onto a shingle, where the greedy chickens guzzled them.
</p>

<p>
"Stop it, Marilyn" I shouted.
</p>

<p>
MORE TO COME...

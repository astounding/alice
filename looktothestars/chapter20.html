     With the holidays behind, I moved my belongings from our bachelor
quarters at Vergene Simpkins' home, to Winferd's dinky apartment.  Kate
had been a second mother to me for a year and a half of college, providing
the place to live and the groceries.  Kate had fussed over me, loved me,
and worried about me.  A lifetime of gratitude or good deeds on my part
could never repay her for all that she had meant to me.  Vergene's apart-
ment would be more serene without me, since there were still three school
teachers, Kate, Edna Heaton and Sylvia Jones  living there, and one
student, LaVema Heaton.  The extra closet space would be appreciated.

     Winferd took me to live in the basement laundry room that had been
his quarters since starting school.  He paid his rent by sweeping snow
and making fires for Amy Leigh.  The cubby-hole "apartment" was furnished
with two built in,cast iron,laundry tubs, hot and cold running water, and
assorted pipes, both large and small, that criss-crossed the ceiling.
Winferd had squeezed in his camp cot, folding table and chairs, and his
little gas stove.  And that was Home Sweet Home.

     Surveying our bridal suite, I said, "Shall we fix up the place?"

     "You're the lady of the house.  Where do we start?"

     "Let's put a broom stick across this  corner to hang our clothes
on, then we can get your shirts and pants down off those pipes.  We can
use a piece of cretonne for the closet door and to curtain the little
window."

     The transformation began.  An Indian blanket replaced the denim camp
quilt on the bed, and a bright flowered cloth covered the metal table.
Inspired, Winferd built a couple of shelves for books and dishes, and I
made a curtain for them too.

     "My, what a difference a woman and a piece of cretonne makes," he
grinned.

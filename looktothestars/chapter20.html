With the holidays behind, I moved my belongings from our bachelor
quarters at Vergene Simpkins' home, to Winferd's dinky apartment.  Kate
had been a second mother to me for a year and a half of college, providing
the place to live and the groceries.  Kate had fussed over me, loved me,
and worried about me.  A lifetime of gratitude or good deeds on my part
could never repay her for all that she had meant to me.  Vergene's apart-
ment would be more serene without me, since there were still three school
teachers, Kate, Edna Heaton and Sylvia Jones, living there, and one
student, LaVema Heaton.  The extra closet space would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Winferd took me to live in the basement laundry room that had been
his quarters since starting school.  He paid his rent by sweeping snow
and making fires for Amy Leigh.  The cubby-hole "apartment" was furnished
with two built-in, cast iron, laundry tubs, hot and cold running water, and
assorted pipes, both large and small, that criss-crossed the ceiling.
Winferd had squeezed in his camp cot, folding table and chairs, and his
little gas stove.  And that was Home Sweet Home.
</p>

<p>
Surveying our bridal suite, I said, "Shall we fix up the place?"
</p>

<p>
"You're the lady of the house.  Where do we start?"
</p>

<p>
"Let's put a broom stick across this corner to hang our clothes
on, then we can get your shirts and pants down off those pipes.  We can
use a piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretonne">cretonne</a>
for the closet door and to curtain the little window."
</p>

<p>
The transformation began.  An Indian blanket replaced the denim camp
quilt on the bed, and a bright flowered cloth covered the metal table.
Inspired, Winferd built a couple of shelves for books and dishes, and I
made a curtain for them too.
</p>

<p>
"My, what a difference a woman and a piece of cretonne makes," he
grinned.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=125" class="scanlink">115</a>
At the end of the winter quarter, I took a job at Bradshaw
Chevrolet, and Winferd stayed in school.  That $50.00 a month pay check
looked pretty big.  The depression was on, and prices hit rock bottom.
A three-pound box of soda crackers sold for 18&cent;, and a not-very-pretty
cotton dress could be bought at Penny's for 35&cent;.  People traded labor or
bartered as far as possible, but some things demanded cash.
</p>

<p>
Now that we were rich, we rented an apartment with room to move about
in.  Before, one of us had to exhale, when the other went by.
</p>

<p>We moved into Stephen's Apartments on Main Street.  The rooms were big,
pretty, and fully furnished.  There was a bathroom, too!  It was like getting
heaven for $10 a month.
</p>

<p>
Winferd became a victim of a teacher's contract fraud.  For a $25.00
fee, a phony firm guaranteed him a contract at the end of the school year.
The salesman who took his money did a lively business throughout Utah
before being convicted.  Winferd was summoned to Salt Lake City to testify
in court, so early one Monday morning, I took him to the Union Pacific
Depot to catch a train.
</p>

<p>
Becase we had overslept, there was barely time for him to dress and
grab his suitcase, while I slid into my slippers and kimona.  The town was
just beginning to rouse, so Main Street was deserted.
</p>

<p>
Stopping the Chevy under the trees by the city park, Winferd turned
off the ignition, gave me a big hug and a kiss, then bounded across the street
to the Depot.  The train pulsated and puffed as it idled on the track.
Winferd was the last passenger to climb aboard.  The whistle blew, and the
wheels began to grind.  Fascinated, I watched until the caboose disappeared,
then with a sigh, I stepped on the starter of the car.  Nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," I whispered, "It can't be stalled here!"  Over and over I tried,
but there was not one spark of life.
</p>

<p>
By now the town was fully awake and Main Street bustled with people.
I was a sight!  My hair hadn't been combed, my pajamas looked slept in,
and the Japanese silk of my kimona fluttered bright as a beacon light.  The
scuffs on my feet were little better than being barefoot, and our apartment
was at the opposite end of Main.  What a predicament!
</p>

<p>
"Please help me," I cried in humiliation to the boy at the corner
service station. "My car won't start."
</p>

<p>
Leaving his gas pump, he looked under the hood of the car, but he was
as helpless as I.  I wished I could become invisible.  Certainly I couldn't
march down Main Street looking like this.
</p>

<p>
I fled to a wash east of the park, and followed its meandering route
back of town.  My sandals scooped gravel and my feet hurt.  what a tortuous
detour!  Hurrying along the least inhabited alleys, I eventually
came to my end of Main, and there I had no choice but to cross.
</p>

<p>
For once, when I least wanted to be noticed, the man at the service
station across from our apartment bubbled with good humor.  "Good morning
Alice," they called, then one of them added, "Well, well.  Did you
get up before breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=126" class="scanlink">116</a>
"Sure did," I sheepishly grinned.
</p>

...

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=127" class="scanlink">117</a>
"This can't happen to me," I cried.  grabbing the phone, I dialed.
"Operator, give me Medford 2740 in LaVerkin, please."  There just might be
time for Winferd to run the glasses up to me, if he broke the speed limit.
</p>

...

I take my hat off to song writers, the melodious historians of our
country.  They have faithfully captured important events and moods, setting
them to music.  "Side by Side" was a fun dance tune, and the words, as we
sang along, had a substantial goodness.  the following words are not exactly
correct, but they convey the message:
</p>

...

<p>
He never did.
</p>

<p>
Walter Segler had planted a crop of carrots for the market, but was
not able to sell so much as a bushel of them, so he invited us to help
ourselves.  They were big, crisp and sweet, and we ate them until we were
almost carrot color.  During December, Winferd got one week's work on a
road job at Short Creek.  His check came to $17.00.  That was all of the
cash we had for the rest of the winter.

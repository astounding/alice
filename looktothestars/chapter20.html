With the holidays behind, I moved my belongings from our bachelor
quarters at Vergene Simpkins' home, to Winferd's dinky apartment.  Kate
had been a second mother to me for a year and a half of college, providing
the place to live and the groceries.  Kate had fussed over me, loved me,
and worried about me.  A lifetime of gratitude or good deeds on my part
could never repay her for all that she had meant to me.  Vergene's apartment
would be more serene without me, since there were still three school
teachers, Kate, Edna Heaton and Sylvia Jones, living there, and one
student, LaVema Heaton.  The extra closet space would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Winferd took me to live in the basement laundry room that had been
his quarters since starting school.  He paid his rent by sweeping snow
and making fires for Amy Leigh.  The cubby-hole "apartment" was furnished
with two built-in, cast iron, laundry tubs, hot and cold running water, and
assorted pipes, both large and small, that criss-crossed the ceiling.
Winferd had squeezed in his camp cot, folding table and chairs, and his
little gas stove.  And that was Home Sweet Home.
</p>

<p>
Surveying our bridal suite, I said, "Shall we fix up the place?"
</p>

<p>
"You're the lady of the house.  Where do we start?"
</p>

<p>
"Let's put a broom stick across this corner to hang our clothes
on, then we can get your shirts and pants down off those pipes.  We can
use a piece of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretonne">cretonne</a>
for the closet door and to curtain the little window."
</p>

<p>
The transformation began.  An Indian blanket replaced the denim camp
quilt on the bed, and a bright flowered cloth covered the metal table.
Inspired, Winferd built a couple of shelves for books and dishes, and I
made a curtain for them too.
</p>

<p>
"My, what a difference a woman and a piece of cretonne makes," he
grinned.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=125" class="scanlink">115</a>
At the end of the winter quarter, I took a job at Bradshaw
Chevrolet, and Winferd stayed in school.  That $50.00 a month pay check
looked pretty big.  The depression was on, and prices hit rock bottom.
A three-pound box of soda crackers sold for 18&cent;, and a not-very-pretty
cotton dress could be bought at Penny's for 35&cent;.  People traded labor or
bartered as far as possible, but some things demanded cash.
</p>

<p>
Now that we were rich, we rented an apartment with room to move about
in.  Before, one of us had to exhale, when the other went by.
</p>

<p>We moved into Stephen's Apartments on Main Street.  The rooms were big,
pretty, and fully furnished.  There was a bathroom, too!  It was like getting
heaven for $10 a month.
</p>

<p>
Winferd became a victim of a teacher's contract fraud.  For a $25.00
fee, a phony firm guaranteed him a contract at the end of the school year.
The salesman who took his money did a lively business throughout Utah
before being convicted.  Winferd was summoned to Salt Lake City to testify
in court, so early one Monday morning, I took him to the Union Pacific
Depot to catch a train.
</p>

<p>
Becase we had overslept, there was barely time for him to dress and
grab his suitcase, while I slid into my slippers and kimona.  The town was
just beginning to rouse, so Main Street was deserted.
</p>

<p>
Stopping the Chevy under the trees by the city park, Winferd turned
off the ignition, gave me a big hug and a kiss, then bounded across the street
to the Depot.  The train pulsated and puffed as it idled on the track.
Winferd was the last passenger to climb aboard.  The whistle blew, and the
wheels began to grind.  Fascinated, I watched until the caboose disappeared,
then with a sigh, I stepped on the starter of the car.  Nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," I whispered, "It can't be stalled here!"  Over and over I tried,
but there was not one spark of life.
</p>

<p>
By now the town was fully awake and Main Street bustled with people.
I was a sight!  My hair hadn't been combed, my pajamas looked slept in,
and the Japanese silk of my kimona fluttered bright as a beacon light.  The
scuffs on my feet were little better than being barefoot, and our apartment
was at the opposite end of Main.  What a predicament!
</p>

<p>
"Please help me," I cried in humiliation to the boy at the corner
service station. "My car won't start."
</p>

<p>
Leaving his gas pump, he looked under the hood of the car, but he was
as helpless as I.  I wished I could become invisible.  Certainly I couldn't
march down Main Street looking like this.
</p>

<p>
I fled to a wash east of the park, and followed its meandering route
back of town.  My sandals scooped gravel and my feet hurt.  what a tortuous
detour!  Hurrying along the least inhabited alleys, I eventually
came to my end of Main, and there I had no choice but to cross.
</p>

<p>
For once, when I least wanted to be noticed, the man at the service
station across from our apartment bubbled with good humor.  "Good morning
Alice," they called, then one of them added, "Well, well.  Did you
get up before breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=126" class="scanlink">116</a>
"Sure did," I sheepishly grinned.
</p>

<p>
I couldn't stand at the curb waiting for the traffic to ebb, so I
darted through the first gap between cars, and into our apartment house.
</p>

<p class="bulletspace"></p>

<p>
Although our apartment had a gas stove and refrigerator, I yearned to
acquire something of our own.  I went in debt $300 for an electric stove
and refrigerator, to be paid at $10 a month.  Electric appliances were
a luxury, and priced high.  Although the new things looked beautiful in our
kitchen, still the monster debt nagged me.
</p>

<p>
When school let out, Winferd got his teaching certificate, but no contract.
The depression was so acute there was not a single vacancy.  Uncle
John had been right when he steered me into business.  Winferd returned to
the farm in LaVerkin, and I stayed on at Bradshaw's.  Then it happened.
Business houses in Cedar City that employed married women were boycotted,
so I lost my job.  My $300 debt might as well have been $3,000.  With no
job and no money, either amount was impossible to pay.
</p>

<p>
A poster in the Civil Service office announced examinations to be
given.  One was for a position in Hawaii.  Why not try for it?  I could work
there at least until we were out of debt.
</p>

<p>
When Winferd came on Saturday night, I broke the news that I had lost
my job.  Spreading out the Civil Service literature, I said, "Look, next
Monday they're giving an examination for a job in Hawaii.  Do you care if I
take it?"  He was silet for a long time.  "I know I can pass.  Please let
me try.  You could get a job in Hawaii too."
</p>

<p>
"Would you like that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I think it would be thrilling."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you come to LaVerkin with me.  The farm is the best place to
be right now."
</p>

<p>
We might as well get some real adventure," I argued.  "Please let me
try."
</p>

<p>
After much coaxing, he finally said, "It's up to you."
</p>

<p>
Sunday evening, before Winferd returned to LaVerkin, we rode up Cedar
Canyon.  Each weekend since we were married, we had either picnicked or
camped there.  In the winter when the road was closed, we had driven as far
as we could, then pitched our tent in the snow.  We were dressed for it,
and we did a lot of hiking and climbing.  Now this chapter of our lives was
coming to a close.  Tomorrow, I would take the Civil Service exam, and let
our apartment go.
</p>

<p>
Kissing me goodbye, Winferd said, "Good luck on your exam," and left.
</p>

<p>
The examination was scheduled for ten the next morning.  I was excited
as I dressed.  Then I discovered my glasses were missing.  I searched everywhere.
Without them, I wouldn't be able to read a word.  Then I remembered.
As Winferd kissed me last night, he ahd removed my glasses, putting them in
the glove compartment of his car!  My heart sank.  The vision of palm trees
and white-capped waves blurred through my outraged tears.
</p>

<p>
<a href="scans.html?p=127" class="scanlink">117</a>
"This can't happen to me," I cried.  grabbing the phone, I dialed.
"Operator, give me Medford 2740 in LaVerkin, please."  There just might be
time for Winferd to run the glasses up to me, if he broke the speed limit.
</p>

<p>
Hello," Ovando said.
</p>

<p>
"Van, I've got to talk to Winferd quick."
</p>

<p>
"Well, he's out in the field somewhere, do you want me to get him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, please.  I'll hold the line."?
</p>

<p>
As I held, minutes dragged into eternity.  Finally the operator cut in.
"Maam, you've held the line until you've run up $2.00 on your call.  Do you
want to hold it longer?"
</p>

<p>
"$2.00," I wailed, "that's all I've got left!"  Sorrowfully I hung up.
It was no use.
</p>

<p>
Throwing myself face down on the bed, I howled.  With the crying over
and my future blighted, I sadly began to pack.
</p>

<p>
That night, Winferd came in his dad's truck.  Handing me my glasses,
he said, "I'm sorry, sweetheart," and I buried my face against his shirt and
bawled some more.
</p>

<p>
Patting me tenderly, he said, "I have found a nice place to live in
Uncle Willie Hardy's house."
</p>

<p>
"How will we pay the rent? I blubbered.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Willie is grazing his calves in Dad's pasture, and I am working
for Dad.  That will take care of it."
</p>

<p>
He was so blooming cheerful as he loaded the truck, that I suspected
his taking my glasses was no accident.  Somehow it didn't even matter.
Happiness oozed through me, and I knew it was going to be fun moving into
Uncle Willie's house.
</p>

<p>
Winferd was right about the farm being the best place to live during a
depression.  Poor President Hoover!  He stoutly resisted the Federal Government
being any part of the dole.  He maintained that that should be in the
hands of the states.  But in the cities, thousands of people were struggling
to stay alive, and finally, federal loans were made to the states to
feed the poor.  The American Red Cross distributed wheat and flour throughout
the nation.  A flatbed truck stopped, and a man lugged one-hundred
pounds of wheat to our door.  It was not asked for, but delivered none-the-less,
throughout town.  Later, when loads of flour came in, we requested
that they <em>not</em> leave any with us.  Undoubltedly it was a life saver to folks
in need.  The "dole" was set up to feed the people, but it was embarrassing
to see many people line up to get their grapefruit, pineapple and corned
beef, who were farm folks and far from starvation.
</p>

<p>
Winferd's work on the farm paid well in milk, eggs and other produce,
but not in cash.  Being penniless was normal, and trading was good.  When
the dance orchestra played for produce, we paid our tickets with turnips,
and danced to the tune of, "We ain't got a barrel of money".  My worn out
dress shoes were replaced with a pair of fifty-cent Keds, which gave quite
a different look to my junior prom formal.

I take my hat off to song writers, the melodious historians of our
country.  They have faithfully captured important events and moods, setting
them to music.  "Side by Side" was a fun dance tune, and the words, as we
sang along, had a substantial goodness.  the following words are not exactly
correct, but they convey the message:

Once, when the cows went down on their milk, we were without butter
for quite a while.  Then, one cold winter day, Winferd found a broken crate
of bakery bread along the highway.  Gathering it up, he brought it home.
Bakery bread was like cake to us.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Eunice Hardy said, "If you'll trade me half of your bread, I'll
pay you in butter."
</p>

<p>
It was a deal!  We enjoyed the luxury of buttered toast for quite
sometime.
</p>

<p>
That winter, blackbirds came in clouds to feast on the scattered seed
in the cane fields.  Winferd and Walter Segler shot into a flock, bringing
down 150 of them.  After they were gathered and cleaned, Winferd brought
me seventy blackbird breasts.
</p>

<p>
"Let's have blackbird pie for dinner." he said.
</p>

<p>
After the meat was browned and arranged in a pan for the crust, I
turned sick at the thoughts of the seventy lives it took to make one pie!
We at it because it would have been sinful not to, but the meat was
dark and tough, like eating crow.
</p>

<p>
"Please," I begged, "don't ever kill anymore blackbirds!"
</p>

<p>
He never did.
</p>

<p>
Walter Segler had planted a crop of carrots for the market, but was
not able to sell so much as a bushel of them, so he invited us to help
ourselves.  They were big, crisp and sweet, and we ate them until we were
almost carrot color.  During December, Winferd got one week's work on a
road job at Short Creek.  His check came to $17.00.  That was all of the
cash we had for the rest of the winter.

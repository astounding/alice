<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">O</span>N</span>
my last pilgrimage downtown I met an old office friend.
We stopped at a busy intersection
to chat. The city streets were
harassed with the snarl of the
early morning traffic. People were
rushing to work. Jubilantly I
said, "Jake, we're moving away.
I am on my last errand downtown. We're going to become
ranchers."
</p>

<p>
<em>"Ranchers!"</em> he exclaimed. "I
can't think of anything more miserable. Are you sure you know
what you're doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite sure." I grinned.
</p>

<p>
As we talked, a little breeze
scuttled between the canyon
walls of the buildings stirring up
cigarette wrappers and gum papers in the gutter.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't stand to live in the
country. It would drive me crazy," he said. "Are you sure you
want to leave all this? Just listen!"
</p>

<p>
I listened. All of the sights and
sounds around me were the gears
and cogs of the big machine that
was the city. The day was well in
motion.
</p>

<p>
"I love it," he continued. "I
wouldn't leave this, nor my office
for all of your open country."
</p>

<p>
And I don't believe he would.
He sort of looked like a piece of
office equipment; a little too pale
and already becoming hollow
chested from leaning over a desk
too many years.
</p>

<p>
Sadly he shook his head. "I
feel sorry for you. You're making
a wild choice, but I wish you
luck." He gave me a goodbye
handshake and I watched him
sprint across the street before the
light changed. He would take the
elevator up to the fifth floor of
an old smoky building, put his
key in the door and let himself
into his stuffy, paper cluttered
little office. From his window he
would look down on the top of
department stores and service
stations. In the distance he would
be able to see black clouds rolling
forth from a pair of smokestacks.
</p>

<p>
Back at the house I closed the
drapes for the last time on the
one picture window. It had been
a chummy window. Always I
could look out of it right into
the picture window of the house
next door. Our house had been
cozy, but now the rooms were
bare. We made our final inspection then locked the door. After
we pulled the trailer out of the
drive, we looked back at the
yards. The grass and the concrete were continuous with the
grass and concrete of the man's
next door. We drove past the
houses on our avenue. Each one
was its own little foreign country
where strangers dwelt.
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">I</span> SHALL</span>
never forget the day we
pulled up to the ranch house. It
was early evening. The sun was
settling into the grove of trees
behind the barn, sending red
shafts of light through the pillars
that were the lodgepole pines. I
stood transfixed on the wide back
porch. The yard was a riot of
flowers&mdash;pink peonies, painted
daisies, blue delphiniums, and a
carpet of purple and yellow violas
that ran helter-skelter into the
tall grass. From the pole fence at
the edge of the garden the meadow sloped down to a meandering creek. The creek was flanked
with willows and serviceberry
bushes. Beyond lay the wheat
fields and alfalfa bordered with
quaking aspens and ponderosa
pines. Dew was already gathering
on the grass and the air was
crisp and cool. It was hard to believe that this was home, really
and truly home. It seemed more
like an exotic vacation spot where
one would be privileged to spend
only a night or two.
</p>

<p>
A swing in the yard invited
me. As it fanned me high above
the corral fence I could see a
neighbor's house half obscured by
trees. In a sweep the view encompassed timber land and mountains in the distance against the
sky. Swings are great. They
aren't just for the young, but
mighty fine for anyone's anatomy.
</p>

<p>
We found strawberries ripening in the garden. Daily, we
heaped them high in a large glass
bowl on our table. No dividing
them in individual dishes from
little baskets from the store.
They stayed in season until the
raspberries began begging to be
picked.
</p>

<p>
Our neighbors told us that the
growing season was short. The
seeds we planted seemed to know
it. They grew rapidly. Gathering
crisp vegetables from the garden
is pure pleasure compared to collecting them in a grocery cart at
a super-market. And they have a
flavor that I supposed had vanished with my childhood.
</p>

<p>
The familiar things I find at
the ranch are electricity and butane and the appliances they operate. This permits us to cling to
a way of life that we have come to
expect. The things that are new,
and a never-ending delight are
mostly the native gifts of this
country.
</p>

<p>
I get a nostalgic feeling for the
frontier days in the rustic, pinelined lean-to. On cool days I fill
the woodbox from the grove and
make a fire in the stove just for
the sound of it, the smell of it,
and the feel of it. In this room I
can enjoy the patter of the rain
on the roof. The rest of the house
is as modern as today.
</p>

<p>
There is a well in the flower
garden. The water is cold and
sparkling and good. So different
from the treated water we were
used to in the city. An electric
pump delivers it into the house.
</p>

<p>
Outdoors beckons every day. I
walk through the meadow helping
my husband move the cows from
one pasture to another, or I go
into the grove for an armful of
wood, or down to the garden to
water or hoe. I thrill to the feel
of the wind, the rain, and the sun.
My wanderlust feet take me
along the creek and I see the
water dimple where a small fish
snatches a bug from the surface.
I stop to eat a handful of serviceberries, remembering from reading history that these berries supplied nourishment for the Indians
and early pioneers. Wild fruits
and flowers flourish along the
fence line, the creek, and through
the meadow. As I walk I find little bluebells, thistles with purple
pom-poms, wild geraniums, larkspurs, poppies, and daisies. Mushrooms grow from a vivid red
color to a startling white.
</p>

<p>
It is here that I saw my first
fairy ring. It was just a few days
after a rain. From the house I
could see the luminous white circle down where the meadow dips
the lowest. It was early evening.
The sun had just set. I climbed
over the corral fence and fairly
flew down the slope. There they
were, phosphorescent mushrooms,
making a mystical fairy ring in
the dark grass.

<p>
One night when the air was
warm and still, I looked out our
window to see hungry red flames
leaping up behind the trees the
other side of our grain field. "It
is all right," my husband said.
"The neighbors are burning
brush." We drove over to their
ranch to watch the roaring blaze.
Where else, but in the open country could a fire a quarter of a
mile long be a spectacle of beauty
instead of a tragedy?
</p>

<p>
There isn't a great deal of wild
life on the ranch. There were deer
tracks across the summer fallow
one morning. We see an occasional pheasant in the field, and
ducks stop briefly in the little
pools along the creek. Squirrels
chatter in the trees and crows
hold conventions in the grove and
the meadow. Once in awhile we
see a skunk scurrying for cover.
</p>

<p>
Away from the city lights, we
have re-discovered what a show
the night sky has to offer. Once
more we enjoy the brilliance of
stars and moon and the lightning
when there is a storm. Night skies
in the city are pale above the
street lights and flashing neon
signs. The only lights we see here
at night, aside from those in the
heavens, are the distant mellow
lights from our neighbors' homes
that reach out across our meadow
like a warm handclasp.
</p>

<p>
Farm folks are friendly. Our
neighbors run in with a little jar
of chokecherry jelly or a picking
of beans. They help us harvest
our hay and grain, and doctor a
calf when trouble comes.
</p>

<p>
The ranch women in our neighborhood milk cows, run the hay
baler, and drive tractor. They can
talk wheat varieties, acreage production and market prices. They
keep their hair styled, their nails
manicured, and keep themselves
trim. They are active in politics
and civic affairs. The school bus
picks their children up at the
gates.
</p>

<p>
We are only three miles from a
hospital and a super-market. We
are less than an hour's drive from
the city. Our roads are good, and
the mail man delivers our mail
each day.
</p>

<p>
The glamor of the city is ours
to enjoy when we wish, and yet
we are out under a wide expanse
of sky surrounded by stretches of
fields and forest-fringed meadows. We enjoy again the drama
of the sunrise and the sunset.
</p>

<p>
I am as filled with wonder as
though I had just discovered
America.

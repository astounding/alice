<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword">I'll</span> never forget the time that
Aunt Lou got canned. Father says
<em>canned</em> isn't the right way to say
it. He says she was dismissed.
But Aunt Lou insists she was out
and out <em>canned, fired</em> that is.
</p>

<p>
We had finished our evening
meal and were putting the last of
the dishes away when our bell
rang. Mother opened the door
and there stood Aunt Lou, her
face flushed pinker than the suit
she was wearing.
</p>

<p>
"Elaine!" she stormed, "I'm a
washout. A flop. A failure!"
</p>

<p>
"Sounds perfectly terrible,"
Mother said with mock seriousness.
"Come in and tell us how
you figured that out."
</p>

<p>
Father put down his newspaper.
"Hi, Sis."
</p>

<p>
"Clint," she choked, "I could
just die. I got canned today!"
</p>

<p>
"Canned!" Mother and Father
both spoke at once.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, canned. Fired, and I'm
through. My whole life is washed
down the drain." Her chin trembled
as she spoke, and tears
threatened to fall.
</p>

<p>
Nancy, Craig, and I stood
watching her in wonderment.
Mother said, "You children run
out and put the garden tools
away."
</p>

<p>
"I haven't wiped the cupboards
around the sink yet," I said.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Judy. Finish up
and then go and help Nancy and
Craig."
</p>

<p>
They didn't have a good excuse
for not going out, as I did.
</p>

<p>
"I could just as well have lived
the rest of my life without this
happening to me," Aunt Lou lamented.
"I can't understand.
After working for fifteen years
and loving it, to think I'd land in
a spot where they'd fire me!"
</p>

<p>
<em>A spot</em> is exactly what father
had called it, when Aunt Lou
took that job. Nobody had
wanted her to go to work for
those insurance brokers, especially
her husband Uncle Si. She
could have worked forever in the
news office, if his company
hadn't transferred him; but they
did, and, of course, Aunt Lou
moved away.
</p>

<p>
You should have heard the
folks at the news office lament
when she served notice. After
fifteen years I guess they thought
she was an office fixture. She
was mighty popular. Everyone
loved her, and it looked as if the
place would fold if she left; but
it didn't. They hired someone
else.
</p>

<p>
Then a funny thing happened.
Uncle Si was transferred right
back here again. That's when
Aunt Lou took this insurance
job. She said with Kenny in dental
school, they could use an extra
pay check. That's when she had
started to be a career girl in the
first place&mdash;when her boys and
girls began to go off to college
and on missions.
</p>

<p>
And now, after only two
months in insurance she was canned.
Mother and father were
pretty serious now. They were
sitting on the sofa, one on each
side of her. I could hear her telling
them how hard she had tried
to learn the details of her new
job. How much she had put into
it, and <em>still</em> something went
wrong.
</p>

<p>
"I'm washed up. Do you understand?
I'm a failure. Can
you imagine what it feels like to
be a failure?" She put her hands
over her face and sobbed like a
little girl. She really isn't very
big, you know.
</p>

<p>
I felt real sorry for her. I knew
exactly how she felt. I remember
once when I was a failure. It was
terrible. It was when I had to
make a poster for school and
everyone laughed at it. The boy
who sat behind me had said,
"Judy, for an artist, you are a
failure." My life was blighted.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to go comfort Aunt
Lou. I wanted to tell her that
success sometimes comes right
after failure, because it did with
me. The very next week, when
my piano teacher had a recital,
she reserved my number for the
last because she said it was the
most polished. She said my performance
was a real success.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lou was talking about
something now that I didn't understand.
The word was <em>senility</em>.
Her supervisor had said it was
harder to learn new things when
senility was beginning to set in.
Mother said "Humph!" and father
roared with laughter.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lou was on the defense.
"It is not funny, Clint. It is serious.
Nobody wants me because
I'm too old. That's the real reason
I got canned. They said a
younger person would take to the
countless details faster. They
couldn't spend any more time
trying to break me in." She
looked totally crushed. "They
became very gentle and kind
when they handed me my pay
check. 'Don't be discouraged,
Lou. You have not failed. You
weren't cut out for this job,
that's all. You'll find a spot
somewhere, where you will fit, we
know. Goodbye now. Drop in
and see us sometime. We'll want
to know how you get along.' I
felt like an old horse being turned
out to pasture."
</p>

<p>
It was hard for me to keep polishing
cupboards. I wanted to
run into the living room, throw
my arms around her and tell her
that even if she did have senility,
whatever it was, we loved her.
</p>

<p>
She sat staring miserably at
the floor. "I have never tasted
the bitterness of defeat before.
I've always had faith in myself,
that I could do anything I
wanted to if I tried hard enough.
My self-confidence is completely
shaken. I won't have the courage
to try again." Her heavy sob
was almost a moan.
</p>

<p>
Father looked stern. "I suppose
you are the first person to
have ever been dismissed from a
job."
</p>

<p>
She hesitated. "I can't think
of anyone right now."
</p>

<p>
"Of course you can't," Mother
said. "People are too prone to
think they are the only ones who
have troubles. What about Mr.
Beahm next door? He lost one
job after another until the employment
office urged him to
take a special training course.
Look at him now. One of the
main cogs in the wheel with his
company."
</p>

<p>
Father said, "If everyone in our
country who had been dismissed
from a job refused to try again,
we would all be swept out to sea
under a tide of unemployment."
</p>

<p>
"But most of the people you
have in mind are younger than I.
I am being washed up just a few
years before retirement age. My
career is ending on a down beat,
leaving me forever smarting under
the whip of being canned."
</p>

<p>
Father said, "You must be a
tottering fifty-six. Look, Sis,
when you fall down, you can't
just lie there. You have to get
up."
</p>

<p>
Mother said, "It's no use to
tell you to forget it. You're going
to brood all night anyway.
But there's one nice thing about
it. You don't have to go to work
tomorrow. You'll be free to visit
with me and to see some, friends."
</p>

<p>
Mother is very practical. She
can make good use of any situation.
</p>

<p>
Then Aunt Lou said forlornly,
"Sweet are the uses of adversity.
I may as well go along."
</p>

<p>
Mother looked as if she had
scored a home run.
</p>

<p>
Wearily Aunt Lou arose. "It's
time I was at home fixing Si's
dinner. I must be going."
</p>

<p>
"I'll pick you up at 1:30 tomorrow,"
Mother said.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be ready," Aunt Lou
replied.
</p>

<p>
The next day Father took
Nancy and Craig to the ranch
with him to help tie grain sacks.
Mother had some peaches to put
up and I stayed to help her. By
pushing, we were through by
noon.
</p>

<p>
After lunch I brushed my hair
until it was soft as silk, and put
on my yellow tissue gingham.
Mother looked surprised to see
me dressed up.
</p>

<p>
"Judy, you look fresh as a
flower. Would you like to come
along with me and Aunt Lou this
afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
I was hoping she would ask.
When I was little she used to take
me with her when she made visits.
I loved to go with her to see
her friends. I had always liked
older people.
</p>

<p>
When we picked Aunt Lou up
she appeared tired. She got into
the car and sat down with a sigh.
There were shadows around her
eyes. She apparently hadn't
slept the whole night through. If
mother noticed it she didn't
let on.
</p>

<p>
"How long has it been since
you've been to see Sister Karr?"
Mother asked.
</p>

<p>
"Years," Aunt Lou confessed.
"I know she lives alone, and I've
always meant to go, but haven't.
I always speak to her at church
on Sundays."
</p>

<p>
We whisked around a few corners
and stopped under the shade
of a weeping birch alongside a
white picket fence.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lou brightened. "What
a pretty yard."
</p>

<p>
"Yes. Sister Karr keeps it up
herself."
</p>

<div class="picbox">
  <img src="images/whenuponlifesbillows2.jpg" alt="Illustration of a house, roof, and ladder from Relief Society Magazine" />
</div>

<p>
We walked past tall blue spikes
of delphiniums and masses of
painted daisies. The garden was
a medley of color. A movement
on the roof of the house attracted
our gaze. It was Sister Karr,
scrambling down over the shingles
to reach the ladder.
</p>

<p>
"What in the world are you up
to?" Mother demanded.
</p>

<p>
Sister Karr paused on the second
round of the ladder to push
her hair back from her face. "I'm
fixing my roof. It leaked a bit
when it rained the other night."
</p>

<p>
"You should not climb up on
the house!" Mother scolded.
"Why didn't you call us. Clint
would be happy to fix it for you."
</p>

<p>
"No," she said firmly, climbing
to the ground. "I'm perfectly
capable of doing it myself."
</p>

<p>
I had always enjoyed running
errands for mother to Sister
Karr's place. She was a spunky
little woman. She used to tell me
about the trees in her yard. She
brought them with her when she
moved from Idaho to Washington
years ago. She had many kinds
and each one had a sentimental
value. She had poured the cement
to make the stepping stones
and walks in her garden, and had
done a lot of the remodeling of
the house herself.
</p>

<p>
"Come in and sit down." She
held open the screen. "I'll fix us
a cool drink."
</p>

<p>
We sank into deep velvet
chairs. The living room was furnished
with treasures from the
past.
</p>

<p>
She brought a pitcher of cold
grape juice. I knew she had prepared
it herself from the Concords
that grew on her back
fence.
</p>

<p>
"We are in luck to find you at
home," Mother said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to be home," she answered.
"I've so much to do here,
I really don't want to go back to
work."
</p>

<p>
"Work!" Aunt Lou almost
choked on the word.
</p>

<p>
"Sister Karr has been <em>living in</em>
with an old couple, taking care of
them," Mother explained.
</p>

<p>
Sister Karr sat down with a
sigh. "I'm glad their young ones
took them home with them. They
were a real care. Tried my patience
some."
</p>

<p>
"How old were they?" Aunt
Lou ventured.
</p>

<p>
"Both in their seventies. Now
I know the next question you're
thinking. I'm eighty-two. Young
woman, when you've lived as long
as I have, you'll discover years
don't regulate your age. It's how
<em>interested</em> you are in life."
</p>

<p>
If <em>that's</em> how age was gauged,
one could see in a glance Sister
Karr would never grow old.
There were family group sheets
on her desk that she had been
working on, and a hooked rug underway
in the next room. And I
knew she was always baking good
things for folks who were ill. She
had brought me some cup cakes
with pink icing on them when I
had my arm in splints.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lou's eyes twinkled.
</p>

<p>
"We'll see you at Relief Society
Tuesday morning, then, if
you're not working."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there," Sister Karr
smiled.
</p>

<p>
Mother says if you don't visit
too long, folks will always want
you to come again. Getting into
the car she said, "We're going to
see Jeanne Douglas next."
</p>

<p>
Jeanne met us at the door. She
looked as though she had just
stepped out of a jewel case. And
that's almost how it was. She
smiled into our eyes as she
greeted us.
</p>

<p>
An oil painting of a mountain
and autumn trees hung above her
fireplace. It was the sort of a picure
that draws you into it.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lou spoke, "I have never
seen a painting more real."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you." Jeanne looked
pleased.
</p>

<p>
"Your name is in the corner.
Have you always painted?" Aunt
Lou asked.
</p>

<p>
"No. Only for about five years.
I didn't try until after my sixtieth
birthday."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you wait until
then?"
</p>

<p>
"Too busy, I thought. Suddenly
I realized I had reached an
enviable age where I could do as
I pleased. I was no longer under
the discipline of childhood, the
torture of adolescence, the uncertainty
of youth, and my family
was grown and gone. So I enrolled
in an art class. There I
found a lot of other folks,
like myself, fulfilling belated
dreams."
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lou brightened like a
rose bathed in dew.
</p>

<p>
We admired other paintings of
hers and visited quite awhile.
</p>

<p>
Mother wanted to call on Sister
Hilton last. She has been in a
wheel chair ever since I can remember.
You never think of it
when you're around her. She is
so cheerful.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," she called gaily
when Mother knocked. She was
knitting a soft blue sweater.
</p>

<p>
She reached out and gave me a
hug, then squeezed Mother's and
Aunt Lou's hands. My eyes lit on
a slim little book with delicate
flowers on its jacket.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Sister Hilton!" I cried,
"This is your new book of poems,
isn't it!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she smiled. "You may
look at it if you wish."
</p>

<p>
Did I ever wish! Sister Hilton
and I were real buddies. I had
to run to her often with exciting
tales of school. Mother would
send me when she had a jar of
jelly or some fresh rolls for her.
Once, when I had a cricket in a
little red box to take to "show
and tell" at school, she wrote a
funny little poem about it for me.
</p>

<p>
She has written poems for
Church publications and women's
magazines. She says they bring
in enough money to buy yardage
to make pretty things for her
great-grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
As I looked at the book, the
others visited. Sister Hilton told
them about an <em>old folks</em> party
she had attended. She said there
were folks there from their middle
fifties to ninety-three. "That
ninety-three-year-old youngster
was the liveliest of them all. He
danced every set, but the one he
sat out with me. 'Look,' he said,
pointing to the exhausted middleagers
sitting out, 'just look at
them, sitting around getting
old.'" She chuckled.
</p>

<p>
We were all three pretty gay
on our way home. Aunt Lou
sang, "When upon life's billows
you are tempest tossed." Mother
and I joined in on, "when you are
discouraged thinking all is lost."
We sang all the way home.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Lou got out at her house.
"Thanks, Elaine and Judy, for
this visiting," she said, "I have
made an important discovery. I
belong to an especially privileged
group bordering on the golden
years, filled with golden opportunities."
She had a dreamy, faraway
look. "There are things
I've always wanted to do. Why
not do them now?"
</p>

<p>
The next day she called at the
publishing office of our local
farm magazine.
</p>

<p>
That was a year ago. Do you
know what she is doing today.
She has just been advanced to
editor of the home section of the
magazine.

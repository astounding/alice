<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword">"Jason,"</span> Salley spoke softly. Jason
did not answer. He was reading the
evening paper. "Jason, honey," she
said. His foot twitched a bit. That
was all the response she got. "Anybody
home?" she asked, and then
added, "obviously not." She put
the magazine down that she had
been reading and went over beside
him. Ruffling his hair, she said,
"Hi, Jason! Remember me? I'm
your wife Salley."
</p>

<p>
Jason stirred and made a gruff
little sound. She knew she had
almost got through to him. Sometimes
he was the deafest and dumbest
person on earth. She glanced at
the paper he was reading. No wonder!
He was intent on the sports
section. She was no competition
for the basketball scores. With resignation,
she retrieved her magazine
and curled up on the sofa.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later he let his paper
fall to the floor. "Did you say
something, Salley?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Salley did not raise her eyes from
the magazine. Silently she went on
reading. He stretched his long arms
and legs luxuriously, and then extricated
himself from his deep chair.
"I declare I heard someone speak.
Have you any idea who it was?" He
stood looking down at her. She
turned a page of her magazine and
continued reading. He ran his
fingers through her shiny curls,
tumbling them. "Hi, Salley, remember
me? I'm your husband Jason."
She went on reading. He pushed
back a curl and kissed her on the
tip of one ear.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jason," she said, "you're impossible.
It was hours ago when I
spoke to you. I have forgotten
what I wanted to say."
</p>

<p>
"But, honey," he protested, "I
couldn't hear you. You see, I was
reading."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said with exasperation.
"Honestly! There isn't another
man like you in all the world! I
ask you a question one day, and you
do not hear me until the next and
then you answer me. By that time
I've forgotten what I asked you."
</p>

<p>
He grinned. "That, my dear, is
one of the remarkable things about
your husband. My mind is equipped
with a delayed action device. Lots of
trouble is averted that way."
</p>

<p>
Now he was teasing her. This was
probably the wrong time to approach
him with the subject she had
wanted to mention.
</p>

<p>
He smiled at her. What a little
pixie she was. A petite little pixie
with a snip nose. He sat down beside
her. "I'm sorry," he said. "Tell
me please what it was you wanted."
</p>

<p>
"I really did want to talk to you,"
she said. "We've been married for
almost three months. Don't you
think it's time that we sat down and
had an&mdash;an interview?"
</p>

<p>
"A <em>what?</em>" Jason's voice went up
to a peak.
</p>

<p>
"An interview. You know&mdash;like
employers and employees do when
they've been together for a certain
period of time."
</p>

<p>
He blinked and made as if to
speak but uttered no sound.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing queer about
that," she explained. "I read all
about it right here in this magazine.
'How to Make Your Marriage
Work,' by Dr. Snodgras." She was
very matter of fact.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't our marriage working?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is, silly, but Dr.
Snodgras says this is supposed to be
our adjustment period. He says that
both of us do lots of little things
that irritate each other, and we
should talk it out and then it won't
irritate us any more."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see," he said indulgently.
"Seems as if I read something like
that in a book once."
</p>

<p>
"You did?" Her enthusiasm rose.
"Then you'll understand all about
it. Tell me what you remember."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see." He wrinkled his
brow. "I believe it said there are
many adjustments to make in marriage&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
yes. I remember
now. It said the wives are the
ones to do the adjusting. Wives
are usualy younger than husbands,
and sometimes smaller, and naturally
more pliable. A husband can't
change. He is big and burly and
set up like hard clay by the time he
gets married. I think that's what
the book said."
</p>

<p>
"You must have read the wrong
book. I guess the interview idea is
not so good after all."
</p>

<p>
"Quite the contrary. I think it's
a fine idea. When do we begin?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you're interested?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"Well&hellip;" she said reluctantly.
"I have made a few notes."
</p>

<p>
"On how to conduct an interview?"
</p>

<p>
She blushed. "No. On things that
I should point out to you."
</p>

<p>
"I see. You mean notes on the
things I do that irritate you." He
pretended to be wounded.
</p>

<p>
"Honey," she said apologetically,
"there's almost nothing wrong with
you. Remember, we aren't discussing
big things&mdash;like money. I
won't even mention the time Jan
asked me to go shopping with her
and you gave me five dollars and
told me not to go hog wild on it
and Jan said, 'That's ridiculous. No
one can go hog wild with only five
dollars.' Dr. Snodgras says big
things seldom undermine a marriage,
because people always correct them.
It's the little things that do it, like
tapping a pencil against your teeth
all the time when you're trying to
think. Little things can be terribly
distracting you know."
</p>

<p>
"I see. And we must be broadminded
and understanding and
practical about the whole discussion."
</p>

<p>
"That's exactly what Dr. Snodgras
said. Jason, you're wonderful.
This is going to be great. Here is
a pad and pencil for you. As I go
over the pointers I have here, things
will come to your mind to jot down
about me. Feel free to interrupt
anytime. You may want to justify
yourself you know."
</p>

<p>
"I'm anxious for you to begin."
</p>

<p>
"You promise me you won't be
hurt?" she asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all. I shall remind myself
that it is all in the interest of
family solidarity." He flashed her a
smile.
</p>

<p>
"You almost disarm me when you
smile at me like that. I am trying
to be very objective. Now, first on
my list I have&mdash;honestly, Jason,
I'm not so sure I like this idea."
</p>

<p>
"It's great! I insist that you proceed.
I can hardly wait my turn,"
he said heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Really? Well then I shall begin.
Let me see&hellip;" She studied her
notes. "First of all&mdash;your shoes.
It always bothers me where you take
them off at nights, because in the
dark I stumble over them. And
speaking of stumbling in the dark&mdash;I
wouldn't have to do it if I
could just wake you. Like the other
night. There were some cats yowling
by our window. I couldn't
wake you, so I had to scare them
away myself. Jason, do you think
you could sleep just a little lighter?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall try," he said obediently
"But, really, Salley, you should turn
on your lamp if you're going to
prowl in the night."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I might wake you if
I turn on my light."
</p>

<p>
"That's what I love about you,
my dear." He grinned. "You are
so consistent."
</p>

<p>
"About your eating habits," she
continued. "I really don't mind if
you want your toast so brown I
almost have to burn it, or your egg
so raw that I have to look the other
way while you eat it, and that you
sugar your tomatoes and salt your
melons. I guess I can get used to
that, but it did bother me when
you said my angel cake was like
trying to eat fog and you scrunched
a piece of it into a little wad because
you said a man needed something
to sink his teeth in."
</p>

<p>
Jason had been speedily jotting
down notes. He looked up.
</p>

<p>
"I apologized about your cake,
dear. Yours is the lightest in the
world. I shouldn't have teased
you."
</p>

<p>
"I forgive you. But couldn't you
try not to be so hungry when you
come home and I don't have dinner
ready? And couldn't you come
home promptly on the days I do
have it ready instead of keeping me
waiting?"
</p>

<p>
He was taking notes again.
</p>

<p>
"You are writing an awfully lot.
Can you listen and write too?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't missed a word. Finish
your list. I'm getting anxious for
my turn."
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">S</span>HE</span>
was losing interest in her own
list, his looked so ominous. But she
must finish what she had started.
"I have a note here to remind you
not to squeeze the toothpaste tube
in the middle, and for you to please
not hang your soiled shirts back in
your closet, and when you wipe
dishes, would you please put the
forks in with the forks and not with
the spoons&mdash;sorry. I meant to
cross that one out. It's nice of you
to wipe the dishes. And couldn't
you change your attitude about
women drivers? Every time you see
a car parked wrong you say some
woman did it. Well, I watched the
other day to see who drove off
in the car that straddled two parking
spaces in the market parking lot. It
was a fat man."
</p>

<p>
Jason had filled the second page
on his pad. Salley stopped and
looked at him. "I don't believe I
had better finish my list now," she
said, "it would be nice for you to
have a turn."
</p>

<p>
He sat thoughtfully studying his
notes.
</p>

<p>
"Will you please go ahead?" she
said. She glanced at the magazine
lying on the stand. In bold red letters
on its shiny cover the title of
the feature article by Dr. Snodgras
glared at her. Actually, she had
been riding on a pink cloud ever
since she had married Jason. She
had been wonderfully happy, until
something she read in that article
punctured a few holes in her cloud.
</p>

<p>
Jason looked up from his list.
Now he was going to deliver the
load. She felt miserable. She
wished she had torn up her list.
There really wasn't one item of importance
upon it. The number one
item on his list would be that she
talked too much. He regarded her
silently. "Go on, Jason, please," she
said in a small voice.
</p>

<p>
She arose. As she did so she
brushed against the magazine and it
fell to the floor. Jason came over
to her and put a big firm hand on
each of her shoulders. He regarded
her tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"I have been writing a list of all
of the things I adore about you,"
he said. "Honey, I wouldn't change
a hair of your head. You are perfect
just as you are."
</p>

<p>
Frustrated and repentant, she
ground her heel into the magazine
on the floor. She buried her face
against him to hide the hot tears.
With a merry chuckle he kissed her.

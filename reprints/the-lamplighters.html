<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword">It</span> is twilight and the hungry
baseball players are straggling
home to their evening meal.
They had such fun today. There
are always all sizes and all ages of
home folks out there playing. It
doesn't make any difference who
comes to play in our friendly little
town.
</p>

<p>
I like to sit here on my front
porch because it is in the very center
of things, where I can actually
listen to the heartbeat of my home
town. Tonight I can hear Wickley's
cows mooing in the pasture. A
cricket chirps in the elderberry
bushes, and there is the twittering
of sleepy birds in the honey locust
tree. Little girls are laughing and
flitting like butterflies on Ed Gubler's
lawn, and I can hear a dog
barking somewhere along the canal
bank. Dennis Church is trudging
by with his milk bucket. Above
the hill, a lone star appears&mdash;the
first star out tonight.
</p>

<p>
Twilight deepens and lights come
on in the houses along the
hillside. I wonder what it was like
when the first lamps were lighted
in this little valley?
</p>

<p>
Fancy takes me back, and I see
the rabbit brush and the greasewood
growing all around me. I can see
my own dear mother-in-law polishing
her lamp chimney and trimming
the wick to light her lamp.
Susanna Gubler&mdash;the first woman
to make a permanent home here in
La Verkin. I wonder how she felt.
It must have been lonely, but still
she was so anxious to move into her
own little rock house that she
hitched up the team and loaded her
belongings into the wagon all by
herself, even to her Home Comfort
stove. No one knows really how
she did it. It took two men to unload it.
</p>

<p>
A few months later another lamp
was lighted in La Verkin, when Aunt
Mae Gubler came here to stay.
There were others who played a
vital part in this drama, who have
gone on, leaving their rich heritage
and hallowed memories. As I sit
here musing, my heart plays strange
tricks&mdash;I see the beloved faces of
those who were here. I pull myself
back in my reminiscing and turn my
thoughts to those early pioneers who
are still living with us today.
</p>

<p>
After Aunt Mae, came Allen
Stout's family in 1902, bringing their
daughter Gretchen, who is now
lovingly known as Sister Stratton.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1903, Thomas
Judd, the founder of La Verkin,
brought his family here to live. Still
with us is his daughter Kate Thompsen
who has been a vital part of our
town ever since. That same year
William Sanders brought his wife
Sarah Amelia. She was expecting
a baby when she came. It was that
fall that the first child was born in
La Verkin&mdash;a little girl, Rosalba, to
Susanna Gubler. Six days later,
Amelia Sanders bore a son, Moroni.
Two new little babies born in the
wilderness as it were.
</p>

<p>
As I sit here on my porch musing,
I hear water running in at the head
of my garden. It has a merry,
laughing sound. Water? What
<!-- 208 -->
did they do for water with which to
bathe those new httle babies when
Rosalba and Moroni were born?
They must have dipped it up from
the ditch and settled it. My goodness!
And the doctor! I know they
didn't phone him&mdash;and he didn't
rush to their aid in his car, not then,
and there was no convenience of a
hospital delivery room. I know the
answer to that one. Aunt Mae
earned the right to be everybody's
Aunt Mae, for she was the doctor
and the nurse, while this little town
was coming into existence. Women
had to help each other then.

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">I</span>N</span>
the early spring of 1905 Arthur
Woodbury folded his tent at
<a href="places/shemutah.html">Shem</a> and brought his wife Harriet
and his small children to La Verkin.
They say the tent was large, and
when it was pitched and boarded
up, it became the scene of many
happy parties. I know how good
those parties must have been. When
Aunt Hattie set her mind to any
social affair, it <em>had</em> to be good.
</p>

<p>
From the deep south came the
Segler family to join the saints in
La Verkin in 1907. With travel so
slow, and roads so dusty and rough,
I often wonder how Hardy and Jim
ever found LaVina and Myrtle.
Hardy must have had to go out and
around by Short Creek to Mt. Carmel,
and Jim's wagon had to creak
over the Black Ridge. Courting
<!-- 209 -->
would have been pretty serious business
in those days. But they found
their brides and brought them here
to help pioneer our little town.
</p>

<p>
So here they are&mdash;our pioneer
women who are still living among
us today: Susanna Gubler, Aunt
Mae Gubler, Amelia Sanders,
Gretchen Stratton, Harriet Woodbury,
Kate Thompsen, Myrtle Segler,
and LaVina Segler.
</p>

<p>
These are the people who lit their
lamps in our valley years ago and
helped push back the desert. They
are the women behind the men who
brought the river through the tunnel,
coursing like lifeblood through
an artery, to nourish the orchards
and vineyards. They are the women
who filled the corn shuck and straw
ticks that their men might rest come
night, and sewed rag rugs to brighten
their homes; who bent over the
old washboard with aching backs.
They are the women who were
sustained as auxiliary heads and
officers and teachers, shouldering as
high as five offices for one person at
a time, so that their children might
be taught the gospel. They sat in
worship in the old bowery, until the
little rock schoolhouse came into
being.
</p>

<p>
As I sit here reminiscing, I see the
new wing of our church house take
the form of that little rock building.
It was there that the first little girl
and the first little boy learned to
<!-- 210 -->
read and to write. It was there they
learned to love music, drama, and
dancing.

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">T</span>HE</span>
sons of the women who lit
the first lamps in our valley
have gone out to be leaders over the
face of this land. Among them are
doctors of science, medicine, language,
dentists, professors, bakers,
star athletes, farmers, engineers,
missionaries, bishops, stake clerks,
Sunday School superintendents,
music directors, and merchants; and
their daughters are following their
footsteps in leadership. They are
the loving wives who light their
homes for their men coming home
when the sun has gone to rest. Also
among them are teachers and skilled
career women, too.
</p>

<p>
This little town is deeply rooted
in the love of those who pioneered
it. Shoulder to shoulder, they
toiled, establishing a bond between
them that has never been broken.
That is why people say "Those
La Verkin people are like one big
family." We sit together on summer
evenings on the church patio
for entertainments. Our women
cook food for ward dinners and their
families come out and eat together.
A breeze rustles the bamboo
canes by my house. There are
myriads of crickets chirping at the
stars. This is my home town, where
there is music, and laughter, and
love. From all the windows across
town shine the lights of these gentle
people. I breathe a silent prayer
of thanksgiving for those first lamplighters
in our valley, for they have
surely fulfilled holy writ which says:
"Let your light so shine before men,
that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father which is in
heaven" <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5.16?lang=eng#p15">(Mt. 5:16)</a>.

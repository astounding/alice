<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">"E</span>LLIE,</span>
you aren't eating your
supper." Mother looked at
me in concern. I choked.
"Really mother, I just can't seem
to swallow tonight."
</p>

<p>
Nancy eyed the food before her.
"Me, too. How come your stomach
gets all tied up in knots when
you're excited?"
</p>

<p>
"That's 'cause you're thinking
too much, like me." Tom reached
for his fourth muffin. "When I
shut my eyes, I can just see the
fish splashing and the sun shining
on the water. I almost can't eat
either, just thinking about it."
</p>

<p>
"Now look here." Daddy put
down his fork. "We can't take a
pack of starved coyotes along
with us. You young ones better
relax and eat your supper. You'll
need energy to help finish packing.
We're going to get an early
start in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"Don't urge them to eat,"
Grandma said. "There were times
when I was a child that I'd get
too excited to eat. Just the
thoughts of going places did it to
me."
</p>

<p>
We looked gratefully at Grandma.
She always understood.
</p>

<p>
We had plenty of energy to
help finish loading. Daddy didn't
need to worry. After all, ever
since I could remember, we had
been going to go to Yellowstone
<em>someday</em>. It was going to be <em>someday</em>
when Daddy had enough vacation
time coming to make the
trip worthwhile; and <em>someday</em>
when there weren't too many bills
to pay, and <em>someday</em> when Daddy
and Mother didn't have special
meetings to interfere, and a hundred
and one other reasons. Well,
believe it or not, that <em>someday</em>
had actually arrived. It was no
longer a dream but a reality.
</p>

<p>
Daddy had rented the biggest
camper he could get. It had two
bedrooms, if you can call them
rooms, one for Grandma, and one
for Daddy and Mother. It had a
gas refrigerator and stove and
running water and&mdash;well just
about all of the comforts of home.
Daddy said he just <em>loved</em> to rough
it. Nancy and Tom and I had
sleeping bags. We wanted to sleep
under the stars. Daddy put in a
tent, "just in case."
</p>

<p>
I washed the supper dishes and
Grandma wiped. "You're excited,
too, aren't you. Grandma?" I
grinned. "You only nibbled instead
of eating."
</p>

<p>
She winked at me. "Tom and
your daddy don't need to think
they're the only fishermen in the
family. I reckon we women folks
might even show them up a bit."
The look on her face gave me a
merry feeling.
</p>

<p>
One thing troubled me about
fishing. That was worms. Tom
had a bait can full of them. I
couldn't tell Grandma I'd never
touched a worm. I'd have to figure
out some natural way to get
someone else to bait my hook.
</p>

<p>
I don't believe Mother cared
much for worms, either. She was
packing embroidery work and
gathering up some magazines to
read. As she reached for her <em>Relief
Society Magazine</em>, an unopened
letter fell to the floor. She picked
it up and looked at the postmark.
The letter was two weeks old.
Quickly she tore it open. For a
minute I thought she was going
to faint. She dropped into a chair
and sat staring at the paper. It
was an important letter, for sure.
</p>

<p>
Mother straightened. "Who put
<em>this</em> inside my magazine?" She
held out the letter like it was a
document from the President of
the United States. We all looked
at each other. The air was very
tense. "Ellie? Tom? Nancy?" As
she looked at each of us, we mutely
shook our heads.
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">D</span>ADDY</span>
cleared his throat. "I'm
sorry, dear. I am the guilty one.
I picked up the mail one day
when I was on an errand. I was
afraid of misplacing your letter,
so I slipped it inside the magazine
you had left in the car. I
must have forgotten it."
</p>

<p>
Whee! That let us three off the
hook.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any damage done?"
Daddy asked.
</p>

<p>
"No. None at all." Mother
looked like she was going to cry.
"We'll just have to postpone our
vacation a couple of days, that's
all."
</p>

<p>
Two days! I wanted to howl.
Tom and Nancy let out a wail.
</p>

<p>
Grandma spoke up. "Did somebody
die, Janet?"
</p>

<p>
Mother smiled weakly. "No,
nothing like that. I have an important
meeting day after tomorrow,
that's all."
</p>

<p>
Well! It must be a Relief Society
meeting! All of us knew
from previous experience that
when Mother had a Relief Society
meeting to attend, nothing
could turn her aside.
</p>

<p>
Grandma wasn't one to be put
off so easily. "What is it, Janet?
Are you the main speaker at the
meeting?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a special meeting for
the Relief Society presidencies in
the stake." Mother had herself
under control. Calmly she turned
to Daddy. "Jim, you've been
wishing you could get away from
the office long enough to fix the
pasture fence and spray the wild
parsnips. This will be a perfect
time to do it." Turning to Nancy
and me, she smiled. "Do you girls
remember the cute pink curtains
we saw down town the other day?
How would you like to get them
tomorrow? I'll help you pretty up
your room." We had wanted the
curtains very much, but right now
they didn't seem important.
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">"J</span>ANET."</span>
Daddy looked like a
little boy as he approached mother.
"Is this meeting so important
that we have to change the family
plans?"
</p>

<p>
"All Church meetings are important,
or they wouldn't be
called." Her voice was very even.
</p>

<p>
"Gee, Dad, that's a tough break
for you." Tom plunged his hands
deep into his pockets. "To think
of that camper going to waste for
two whole days in our backyard."
His voice quavered.
</p>

<p>
"We have to learn to put first
things first, Son. Now come on,
all of you. Let's have family
prayer and you can scamper off
to bed. Sounds as if we've things
to do tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
We all kneeled down together
and Daddy asked Grandma to
pray.
</p>

<p>
Grandma's prayers always
sounded pretty direct. I thought
I knew exactly what she had in
mind when she said, "Help us all
to see things in their true order
of importance."
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">D</span>ADDY</span>
and mother usually discussed
things after we had gone
to bed. Most of the, time we
went right off to sleep, but tonight
we turned out our light and
forgot to close our door. By being
really quiet we could hear almost
everything they had to say in the
living room.
</p>

<p>
Daddy said, "But, Janet, if we
postpone our vacation a couple
of days we won't have time to go
to Yellowstone. My vacation
starts tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
Mother sounded too cheerful.
She said, "Then wo can pick a
place closer to home. You'll get
something accomplished around
here, and we will save on expenses."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ellie," Nancy sobbed.
"Did you hear that? Not go to
Yellowstone after we have waited
all our whole lives!"
</p>

<p>
I tried to comfort her. "Nancy,
I think Daddy is trying to help
Mother figure out some right way
so we can go."
</p>

<p>
"But, Ellie, Daddy and Mother
always agree on everything. They
always do everything they're
asked to do."
</p>

<p>
"That's why everybody likes
them." I said. "I guess they're
the best people in the whole
world besides Grandma. Nancy,
let's go to Grandma's room and
talk to her."
</p>

<p>
We tiptoed down the dark hall.
</p>

<p>
Mother was saying, "Too many
people use their families for an
excuse for not taking Church assignments.
I've always believed
that when we do our duty in the
Church our families are blessed,
and we can enjoy them that much
more."
</p>

<p>
Daddy said, "You are right.
The two are inseparable, but still
there are times when choices
must be made."
</p>

<p>
"Sakes alive," Grandma whispered.
We almost bumped into
her sitting in her doorway.
"Shhh!" she gathered us to her.
"Seems to me we've some figuring
to do." We snuggled against her.
</p>

<p>
"Grandma, what are we going
to do?" Nancy sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, child. I'm thinking.
Your mother wants to go to Yellowstone
as much as any of us.
She has so much loyalty that she
doesn't know what to do with it
all."
</p>

<p>
"I wish she hadn't found that
letter, then she would have been
happy until we got back."
</p>

<p>
"Yeah. Remember the time
she forgot a meeting and the
whole family went swimming. It
was a blast!" Tom whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Tom! Where did you come
from?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't sleepy so I came to
Grandma's room. It would take
a written excuse from the King
of England to keep mother from
that meeting."
</p>

<p>
"Not from the King, from the
bishop," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Ellie, that's it! You young
ones scamper off to bed so we'll
be ready to leave in the morning."
Grandma fairly pushed us
toward our rooms.
</p>

<p>
Through the partition wall between
our bed and Grandma's
reading table, we could hear her
dial her phone. We couldn't hear
what she said. Minutes later
there was a knock on the front
door and we heard Daddy say,
"Come in, Bishop, what a pleasant
surprise to see you tonight."
</p>

<p>
Nancy and I hurried out into
the hall. Grandma and Tom were
there ahead of us peering through
the bannister into the living
room.
</p>

<p>
"Brother Sorenson," the bishop
boomed, "the camper in your
yard reminded me that you are
going fishing. I have some fancy
lures I thought you might like
to try." He put a little box on
the table.
</p>

<p>
"That's mighty thoughtful of
you. Bishop," Daddy said. "I
guess we won't be leaving for a
couple of days."
</p>

<p>
"Couple of days!" There was
surprise in the bishop's voice.
"Understood you were going in
the morning."
</p>

<p>
"There's a Relief Society meeting
Wednesday," Mother said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know. Haven't you a
couple of counselors. Sister Sorenson?"
</p>

<p>
Mother hesitated. "Why, yes.
But this is a presidents' meeting."
</p>

<p>
"So it is. But, remember, there
are three people in the presidency.
Your counselors will be
glad to go alone this time for
this planning meeting. We must
not make service in the Church
a burdensome thing. When it
is done right, it is very joyous.
All our organizations are patterned
after a perfect plan. Our
families are part of this plan. It
is built around them. Now, go
with your family and have a
happy vacation."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you so much. Bishop.
I will call Sister Hansen tonight."
There was the happiness of a
burden lifted, in Mother's voice.
</p>

<p>
"My blessings go with you. We
love you both for your faithfulness.
Goodnight." With a handshake,
the bishop was gone.
</p>

<p>
We were hugging each other in
the dark.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence,
then Mother said softly, "Isn't it
strange that he should come by
tonight!"
</p>

<p>
"Strange and wonderful," Daddy
said.
</p>

<p>
Mother sat down at the telephone
and Daddy started for the
hall. Swift as rabbits we fled for
our rooms and into our beds.
Daddy turned the hall hghts on
and came whooping up the stairs
with a bound that shook the rafters.
</p>

<p>
"Look out Yellowstone, here we
come!"
</p>

<p>
Bursting into our room, he
gave us each a resounding goodnight
kiss, and playfully tucked
us in, including Grandma.

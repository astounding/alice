long shadows of the summer sunset were spreading
like cool fingers across the
fevered brow of day. Summer evenings were a most treasured part of
my childhood. Sunset meant homecoming time at our house; it was
sort of an unwritten law. However
we could play in the lane in front of
the house with the other children
until we were called.
</p>

<p>
My cousin Iantha and I were happily squishing the dust in the road
between our toes, when a plaintive
voice asked, "Will you two walk
home with me?"
</p>

<p>
We looked up. There was Julie,
and my goodness, she was fifty miles
from home. Well, at least a whole
mile, because her house was the
other side of town.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my, I can't go anywhere
now," I said, "because the sun is
almost down."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is," she said, "that's
why I want you to go with me. It
will be dark before I get home and
I'll be afraid."
</p>

<p>
Iantha said, "Oh, come on. Let's
take her home."
</p>

<p>
"I can't," I protested.
</p>

<p>
"If both of you go, then you won't
have to come back alone," Julie
pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't."
</p>

<p>
"All right, don't you go with me
then," she said with a toss of her
head, "but I'll tell you one thing,
if you don't, then the bad man will
get you."
</p>

<p>
"He won't, really, will he?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"He will, really," she affirmed.
</p>

<p>
Julie was ages and ages older than
I was. She was born the year before
I was, and that would make her lots
smarter. She probably knew lots
more about the bad man than I did.
</p>

<p>
I looked toward the house where
mama would be putting supper on.
She would be pouring creamy milk
from a pan into the green glass
pitcher, and she would put on a
plate with a hundred slices of bread
on it&mdash;well a lot of slices anyway,
because it took lots of bread for all
of us. When we sat down to eat
bread and milk and fruit at nights
we circled clear around the big table
that Uncle Jake had built for us.
You see there were five sisters and
mama and papa and a little baby
brother, with curly hair, who was
the cutest baby in the world, and
Grandma Isom. Grandma always
fussed over me because I was named
for her, but I worried her, too. She
would say, "My lands, how that
child exaggerates!" I always wondered what she meant.
</p>

<p>
I had the urge to run fast into
the house where the family was, before Julie could say another word,
but I didn't.
</p>

<p>
"We'd better hurry, Iantha, and
take Julie home," I said, so the three
<!-- 491 -->
of us took hold of hands and pattered down the lane.
</p>

<p>
I was the littlest and the youngest, and I wished they would let me
walk in the middle, but they didn't.
Julie got the middle spot, and as we
walked on each side of her to protect her, she told us spooky tales of
things that really, really happened to
people who lived right close around.
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">D</span>USK</span>
was turning into thick
black velvet as we scooted along
through the tunnel of trees to
Julie's house. When we came to
her gate we stood under the climbing trumpet vines.
</p>

<p>
Julie whispered, "And now, because you had to be coaxed, and
didn't come with me when I first
asked you, I'm going to tell you one
thing more. The bad man is going to
get you anyway. He won't get you
until the first night you sleep away
from home."
</p>

<p>
I pulled away and grabbed Iantha's hand, and in utter fright, we
sped down the lane and home.
</p>

<p>
I slipped quietly into the welcome
light of the living room.
</p>

<p>
Papa said, "This is a fine time to
be coming home to supper."
</p>

<p>
The table was cleared already,
and my sisters were washing the
dishes. Mama was humming a tune
as she kept finding more dishes for
my sisters to do. Mama could
always find more dirty dishes, even
where there weren't any, almost.
But you should have heard her sing.
She hummed prettier than anybody;
soft and clear and sweet. Her cheeks
were always pink, too, the kind of
pink that didn't scrub off and that
made her look special.
</p>

<p>
I looked at her, and I wanted to
run to her and tell her my whole
miserable story, but Julie had said
the bad man would get me just as
soon as I told.
</p>

<p>
I stood in the kitchen by the stair
door feeling awfully little. No one
paid any attention to me. The kitchen began to shimmer in front of my
eyes and I felt my chin quiver, so I
climbed the stairs around the turn
and wiped my eyes and hoped no
one could see me.
</p>

<p>
Papa was jouncing Willie, our
baby brother, on his knee and singing, "A chicken went to bed but it
was no use, roll Jordan, roll." Papa
thought Willie was a mighty important baby because he was our
only boy and we already had six
girls. I guessed I'd better get down
off that stairway and go where everybody was.
</p>

<p>
Grandma was reading the Deseret
News and shaking her head every
little while and saying, "Tsk, tsk, tsk,
what a shame!"
</p>

<p>
My sister Mildred got out her
paper dolls that she had cut from
the catalog and asked me to come
and play with her. Mildred was
always good to me.
</p>

<p>
Mama came in, sat down at the
organ, and began softly to chord,
and Papa sang "The Bowery."
</p>

<p>
Everybody acted as if nothing was
wrong. My goodness! You would
think they couldn't help but know
something terrible was going to happen to me!
</p>

<p>
Morning came, and a flock of
quarreling sparrows, tumbling along
the fence in the currant bushes,
woke up the sun. I went into the
garden with my sisters to pull weeds
out of the carrot and turnip row.
The terror of last night seemed like
a bad dream to be forgotten, until
Mildred, yanking on a fist full of
<!-- 492 -->
grass, said, "I wish Mama would let
us go to Oak Creek to see Grandmother Crawford."
</p>

<p>
Oh my! Why did she say that?
Julie's dire prediction loomed before
me like a horrible apparition. I
couldn't go anywhere! Not ever!
All the rest of my life I would have
to stay in Hurricane!
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">I</span></span>
thought of Oak Creek and Grandmother and Aunt Emma. Oak
Creek was the prettiest place in the
whole world, except for the ranch at
Kolob. I closed my eyes, and I
could see the high pink and cream-colored canyon walls, and hear the
soft swish of the Virgin River
through the trees. There was
always a cool canyon breeze that
carried the fragrance of box elder
and Cottonwood.
</p>

<p>
My heart felt all twisted with longing.
There was no place so good
as Grandmother's home in the
summer. She let us gather eggs in
the barn, and we could always find
a handful of sweet, everbearing
strawberries in her garden, and she
had yellow currants. We had only
black ones at home. The cookies
she made were big and golden
brown, all sprinkled with sugar and
nutmeg. They were as much a part
of being at Grandmother's as the
blue willowvvare dishes in her cupboard.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Emma was a part of Grandmother's home, too. She would let
us play with her little wooden dishes,
and her tiny little clock, and she
had some angels that twirled on a
spindle that made chimes ring. She
reminded me of those angels. She
smiled when she spoke, and it was
always of happy things she told us,
and her dark eyes would shine. Her
voice sounded like music that sort
of belonged with Oak Creek and
the gentle canyon breeze.
</p>

<p>
I wished Mildred hadn't thought
of Oak Creek! Mama just might
let us go, if Uncle Louis should
come down with a load of grist for
the mill. She sometimes did. We
would ride back in the wagon on
the sacks of flour, and stay a week,
sometimes, and play with our cousins
in Oak Creek and Springdale.
Our cousins were lots of fun.

Uncle Louis didn't come&mdash;but
wouldn't you just know it!&mdash;Mama
and Papa planned a family vacation&mdash;the
very first one in our lives! We
were going out to Moccasin to see
Aunt Lavern Heaton's family. Moccasin
was out of the State even. It
was clear off in Arizona.
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">M</span>Y</span>
sisters were as excited as if
Moccasin had streets of pure
gold. Just when I would start to
get excited, too, then Julie's dark
prediction would stare dismally at
me. I suffered!
</p>

<p>
Mama baked things in the kitchen
that smelled good all through the
house. Everyone was busy and
happy helping get ready to go. That
is, everyone but me. I helped, but
I wasn't happy. When I smiled I
just turned it on like a mechanical
thing. I wished time would stand
still, but it would not. Jesse Spendlove
drove up to our house in Uncle
Ren's wagon, and our bedding and
grub box and supplies were loaded
in, and I knew that this was the very
last day of my life. But, suddenly,
I decided to get just as excited as
my sisters.
</p>

<p>
It was great to be perched upon
a pile of bedding with the other
children in the wagon. We laughed
<!-- 493 -->
and talked, and guessed what we
would find around each turn in the
road ahead. Far out across the
stretches of wasteland were gray
forms racing wildly with the wind.
I asked Papa if they were wolves,
and he said no, they were tumbleweeds.
Pretty soon we came to a
fence that had a lot of them caught
in it.
</p>

<p>
Way out against the sky was a
blue mountain. It was as blue as
Pine Valley Mountain at home. I
asked Papa if we would go over the
mountain and he said we would
tomorrow. Oh dear! If only I were
going to be with the family tomorrow
I could see what the rocks on
the blue mountain looked like when
you came to them. From home,
Pine Valley Mountain looked as if
it must have blue glass rocks on it,
but it was too far away for us ever
to go over and see. I wished I was
going to live, because then I could
gather my lap full of blue rocks and
take them back home to show to
Iantha. My heart ached with re-
grets, and I became engulfed in a
tide of misery.
</p>

<p>
The sun went down, and Papa
said the horses needed to rest. Jesse
pulled them over onto a flat place
that Papa said would make a fine
camp. He took off the harnesses
and rubbed the dust off their
sweaty flanks, and they snorted as
if it was a mighty fine feeling.
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">W</span>E</span>
ate our supper around the
campfire and then made a
big family bed on a canvas on the
ground. When we were all tucked
in, I lay listening to the contented
sound of the horses munching grain
in their nose bags.
</p>

<p>
My emotions swung like the pendulum of a clock between fleeting
surges of happiness and utter misery.
These things were dear to my heart&mdash;the
embers of the campfire, the
sound of the horses, and sleeping
under the stars; but all was not
serene. I studied the dark bushes
around us, and I knew that lurking
behind one of them was the bad
man, waiting for the folks to fall
asleep so he could get me.
</p>

<p>
This was the zero hour. It didn't
matter what I did now. I could
shout to the hills the whole tale of
my misery if I wanted to. Nothing
would make any difference.
</p>

<p>
I crawled out of my warm spot
between my sisters and snuggled
down under the covers by Mama.
There was no use to tell Papa, because
he would only say, "That's all
a pack of nonsense. Go on back to
your bed and go to sleep," but
Mama would listen.
</p>

<p>
"Mama, the bad man is going to
get me tonight," I whispered.
</p>

<p>
She gave me a little squeeze. "Of
course he isn't," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, he is," I insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Who told you that?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
I blurted out the whole, miserable
story to her.
</p>

<p>
She said, "Don't you ever let anyone
tell you a think like that again.
When things trouble you, always
come and tell me. It is not wrong
to tell something to your mother."
She gave me a hug.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mama!" I whispered, though
my voice was choking, "do you mean
I will really go to Moccasin with
all of you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course you will. Patsy," she
chuckled. Patsy was a pet name
mama used when things were really,
really all right. "Now go on back to
your bed and say your prayers. You
<!-- 494 -->
must remember, the Heavenly Father
is someone you should always
tell your troubles to." She took
my face between her hands and
kissed me.
</p>

<p>
Oh, my! The big load had
dropped from my shoulders. I wanted
to sing and shout and turn somersaults
in the sand, but everyone
else had gone to sleep. I crawled
out of Mama's bed and the breeze
fluttered my nightgown. I looked
up at the sky, and there were at
least two hundred stars. Grandma
wouldn't think I was exaggerating
this time, because the sky was full
of stars.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to tell every star that I
was going to Moccasin for really and
truly, and the bad man wasn't going
to get me. Why hadn't I thought
of telling Heavenly Father about
this? I always said my prayers, but
I hadn't asked the help of Heavenly
Father. I breathed deep, and
kneeled down in the sand. It didn't
matter if it got on my nightgown
now. The only thing I could say
was, "Oh, thank you, Heavenlv
Father."
</p>

<p>
I snuggled down between my sisters
and looked up at the wonderful,
beautiful sky. Each star seemed to
wear a halo, then I realized that I
was looking at them through a blur
of happy tears.

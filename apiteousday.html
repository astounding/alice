<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">D</span>ADDY</span>
always refers to it as
"the happening," and to him I
guess it was. You see, Daddy is
very practical minded&mdash;like bread
and butter without jelly.
</p>

<p>
Susan and I were playing
paper dolls under the dining room
table one evening. We played in
whispers so as not to be noticed,
for it was getting late and we
might be hustled off to bed.
</p>

<p>
"It's about time they learned
the difference between the real
and the imaginary," Daddy was
saying. We knew we were being
discussed again.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," Grandma retorted.
"There's nothing far-fetched
about seeing an elephant turn
into a peacock."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing but an exaggerated
imagination. I think they should
call a cloud a cloud, instead of
an elephant or a peacock. It's
just the idea of the thing. They
fabricate something unreal out
of everything. Take tonight.
Instead of simply putting the
supper dishes away, they twitched
their noses and went 'dingle, dingle'
and bewitched them into the
cupboard. I tell you, that pair
should be brought down to earth
and made to talk normal and
act normal just once."
</p>

<p>
We had heard all this before,
so we went on playing.
</p>

<p>
The most worn-out phrase in
Daddy's vocabulary was "exaggerated
imagination," and he
always used it when he talked
about us. Usually he would end
up saying, "Someday, something
will happen that will bring them
down to earth hard, and it's
going to hurt."
</p>

<p>
Grandma's answer was always
the same, "Pity the day." So we
were expecting that piteous day,
although we had no idea what
was supposed to happen.
</p>

<p>
The next day was Saturday,
and Daddy and Grandma were
in the garden tying up rose
runners. Susan and I hurried
through our work, for usually on
Saturdays we could go upon the
hill to play. We had built a
fairyland there. With old spoons
we had dug out a king's castle
and a witches' den in the bank of
a dry gully. We had a sardine
can for a chariot and white bones
for horses.
</p>

<p>
We had gathered hollyhocks
and were sticking black currant
heads on them and piling them
into a shoe box.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you leave stems
on your flowers? How can you
arrange them this way?" Daddy
asked.
</p>

<p>
Susan spoke up. "They aren't
flowers."
</p>

<p>
The muscles in Daddy's jaw
worked. "They are <em>hollyhocks</em>,
and <em>hollyhocks</em> are <em>flowers</em>."
</p>

<p>
I could feel a lecture coming
on so I hurried to explain. "We
know they are hollyhocks, Daddy,
but when you put heads on them,
they become people, like this
ruflly pink one. She is a fairy
princess, don't you see?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't see."
</p>

<p>
"Now may we go to fairyland?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
Daddy's eyes shot sparks.
"Where?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
Ducking my head, I mumbled,
"We want to go upon the hill."
</p>

<p>
"Well, why didn't you say so?
A hill is a hill, understand?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Daddy. May we go now?"
</p>

<p>
"All right. But don't stay too
long."
</p>

<p>
With our digging spoons and
shoe box, we scurried out the
gate. On the way up the hill we
gathered sego lilies and Indian
paintbrush for the fairy garden
which had to be planted fresh
each time we came to play.
Clearing away the old dried
flowers, we poked the fresh stems
down to where the sand was
damp. Just then a lizzard
streaked past.
</p>

<p>
"A fire-eating dragon!" Susan
shrieked and shot after him.
Tripping, she sprawled to her
hands and knees, then froze to
the spot. Her eyes and mouth
open wide, and she stared as if in
a trance. "Look!" she whispered,
pointing her finger.
</p>

<p>
I squatted beside her and
looked. "All I can see is an old
chicken egg."
</p>

<p>
She came unfrozen. "It isn't a
chicken egg. What chicken would
come up here to lay?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, what is it?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"It is the dragon. He turned
himself into an egg just as I fell.
I saw him."
</p>

<p>
I crawled over to examine the
egg. It was innocent looking
enough, lying there on the bare
earth. I poked around the bush
with a stick. "See, here's a hole,
Susan, a snake could have laid
the egg."
</p>

<p>
"But a snake didn't. This is a
bewitched egg. Inside is a dragon
which is really under a witch's
spell. When we break the egg, the
spell will be broken and the
prince will be set free."
</p>

<p>
"When we break the egg, little
snakes might run up our arms
and legs." I shuddered.
</p>

<p>
She gave me a look of contempt.
Dumping the hollyhocks,
she stuffed the shoe box with
chaparral and cradled the egg
inside. "Come on, let's go."
</p>

<p>
"But we came to play," I protested.
"Our people will be
ruined."
</p>

<p>
"So what! There are plenty
more hollyhocks. Don't you see?
This is an important happening."
Then she chanted, "We'll set the
prince free, under the mulberry
tree!"
</p>

<p>
She clutched the box to her
and we began our descent. Suddenly
she stopped. "Listen," she
whispered. "I hear something
inside." She held the box for me
to listen. There was the scratch-
ing sound of chaparral twigs
against the lid.
</p>

<p>
"Something is running around
inside," I said.
</p>

<p>
Scornfully she said, "No prince
would run around in a shoe box."
</p>

<p>
"All right then, what do <em>you</em>
think you can hear?"
</p>

<p>
She put her ear to the box.
"It is the prince, sending us a
message in code&hellip; He is promising
us a reward for setting him
free!"
</p>

<br />

<p class="dropcap">
<span class="dropcapword"><span class="dropcapletter">A</span>LL</span>
the way home we speculated
on what the reward would
be. The possibilities grew more
exciting with each step of the
way. We ran the last stretch, and
were out of breath when we
reached our yard.
</p>

<p>
"Land sakes!" Grandma exclaimed.
"Back already?" Then
scrutinizing us she asked, "What
happened? You look as if you'd
seen an apparition."
</p>

<p>
We could not speak for our
throats were dry. Susan thrust
the box at Grandma, who lifted
the lid.
</p>

<p>
Daddy put down his shovel
and looked. "Well, what do you
know! Old Speckle is laying
again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" Susan panted,
"Speck didn't lay this egg. This
isn't a laid egg."
</p>

<p>
"Of course it is. You can see it
for yourself."
</p>

<p>
"No, Daddy. I saw a dragon
change himself into this egg."
</p>

<p>
Daddy looked sternly at us.
"Young ladies! Bring that box
here and sit down. We're going to
have a talk. You come along, too,
Grandma."
</p>

<p>
He and Grandma took the
lawn chairs and Susan and I
sprawled on the grass. "Now,"
he said with the formality of a
judge, "will you repeat that last
remark, Susan?"
</p>

<p>
"I saw a dragon change himself
into this egg," she repeated
solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"Kathy, did <em>you</em> see the
dragon?" he inquired of me. I
nodded. "What did he look like?"
</p>

<p>
"Something like a lizzard," I
stammered.
</p>

<p>
"Umm humm&hellip; If we put
this unlaid egg under Old Speckle,
then we can hatch us a dragon."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no. Daddy, we mustn't
do that!" Susan protested. "If
we hatch it, then the prince
would have to be a dragon forever.
We have to break the spell!"
</p>

<p>
Sternly Daddy said, "Very
well! We will break the spell
now! In the first place you saw a
lizzard&mdash;not a dragon, mind
you&mdash;upon the hill&mdash;and not in
fairyland. Get that straight?"
</p>

<p>
The very air felt as brittle as
shattering glass. Surely <em>this</em> was
a piteous day!
</p>

<p>
Then to our astonished ears
came Grandma's laugh. "Tch, tch,
tch," she chuckled. "The hill it
is nowadays and not fairyland,
when such a few short years ago
it was the prairie where a small
boy galloped on his stick horses
chasing Injuns."
</p>

<p>
Annoyed, Daddy said, "All
right, all right&hellip; Now where
were we? Oh, yes, the egg. Where
did you get it?"
</p>

<p>
As Susan told her story.
Daddy's brows were drawn with
perplexity. "Now what do we
do?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"It is simple. I will need a silver
knife. Kathy and I will sit
under the mulberry tree and
you and Grandma can watch.
We'll all say 'abbracadabra,' then
I'll whack the egg. The shell will
crack and the prince will step
out. He'll be big instantly and
stand and bow before us and kiss
our hands and ask us which we'd
rather have, a golden carriage or
a helicopter and we'll take the
helicopter."
</p>

  <img src="images/apiteousday2.jpg" alt="Illustration of a father standing beneath the mulberry tree looking at two little girls kneeling on the ground next to an egg" style="width: 400px;" />
</div>

<p>
"I see," Daddy said. "Go fetch
the silver knife at once."
</p>

<p>
As Susan flew to the house.
Daddy turned to Grandma and
said, "Mark my word, those two
are due for a fall. This fabricated,
imaginary, ridiculous world of
theirs is about to tumble before
our eyes. They are going to be
hurt. Now you will understand
the harm an exaggerated imagination
can do."
</p>

<p>
This was going to be more
than a piteous day. This was
doomsday!
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I scanned Grandma's
face, searching for a grain
of comfort. Sadly she shook her
head. "It is a pity children are
forced to grow up so soon."
</p>

<p>
How baffling! Were we going
suddenly to become big like the
bewitched prince was supposed
to do?
</p>

<p>
Susan returned with the
knife and everyone did as she
said. We had to say "abbracadabra"
three times before it
suited her. Then she whacked the
egg. The world stopped turning
and the sun stood still. My spine
tingled and goose pimples popped
out all over me. If a volcano
should have erupted behind me, I
could not have taken my eyes off
the egg. Susan held it away from
her and a firm yellow yolk, surrounded
by clear white, plopped
onto the grass. No one spoke.
She raised up on her hands and
knees, leaning over the magical
thing.
</p>

<p>
"Wow!" she exclaimed. "Wow!
Take a look! A blob of gold in a
puddle of crystal!" Then she sat
back on her heels and laughed.
Relieved, I rolled with laughter
on the grass.
</p>

<p>
Drooping like yesterday's sego
lily. Daddy slumped down on a
stump. With elbows on knees
and chin in hands he studied us.
Grandma pulled her low weeding
stool next to him and sat down.
With ill-concealed merriment,
she said, "Well, son, they took
quite a tumble, didn't they! They
sure act hurt."
</p>

<p>
Daddy was the one who
seemed to be hurt, but he recovered.
Clapping his hands with
a loud pop, he demanded, "You
little vixens, come here!"
</p>

<p>
Laughing we scrambled to his
side.
</p>

<p>
"What are you laughing for?
Where is your prince?" he
scowled.
</p>

<p>
"He left his gift and scrammed,"
Susan said.
</p>

<p>
"Some gift! A raw egg. Where's
the helicopter? Why aren't you
crying miserably with disappointment?"
</p>

<p>
"Daddy, you're so funny," I
giggled. "We were only pretending,
don't you see?"
</p>

<p>
"It was mighty real pretending,"
he insisted.
</p>

<p>
"Good pretending always is,"
I explained.
</p>

<p>
He spread his hands in a wide,
helpless gesture, and we flung
ourselves into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, kittens," he said
tenderly, "how can you conjure
up something so real and then
let it vanish without being sad?
Don't you feel like crying?"
</p>

<p>
Susan snuggled her cheek
against his. "No, Daddy. You
see, grownups pretend, too.
When Grandma calls us 'punkin'
she doesn't cry because she can't
make pie out of us. Just now you
called us 'kittens.' Do you want
to cry because we aren't covered
with fur and have whiskers? Pretending
is fun. Your pretending
makes us feel soft and cuddly
and loved."
</p>

<p>
Daddy burst into a hearty
laugh. Grandma laughed, too.
</p>

<p>
"I love piteous days," I exclaimed.
"They are fun."
</p>

<p>
Jovially Daddy said, "This is a
happening, little kitten."
